Sorry. The teas are
already on the truck.

- Yea!

You sure buried him deep, Daddy.

[ Chuckles ] Not so deep the Lord

Oh, geez. I am so sick of companies dumping
their crud in our ocean without a permit.

348
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,273
It's not like those permits
are hard to get.

Geez, why is Lisa so mad at me?

Gee, I should cut Dad some slack.

After all, he did take me to the ballet
and the Smithsonian exhibit.
