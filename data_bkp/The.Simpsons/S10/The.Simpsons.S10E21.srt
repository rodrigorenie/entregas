00:17:28,914 --> 00:17:32,111
I am detecting a gigantic
amphibious life-form.

301
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:34,777
It's 80 meters long,
and it's heading this way.

302
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:37,412
Oh, good glavin!
It's on my shoe!

303
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:40,490
- It's a- a small frog.
- [ Croaking ]

304
00:17:40,592 --> 00:17:43,060
Just get off.Just get off there.
Just get out. Get out!

305
00:17:43,162 --> 00:17:45,392
Stupid machine.
Oh, wait a minute.

306
00:17:45,497 --> 00:17:49,297
This isn't the Monsterometer.
It's the Frog Exaggerator! Oy.

307
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:51,426
We're the laughingstock of the town.

308
00:17:53,172 --> 00:17:55,106
Don't worry, Mr. Burns.
We're gonna find that monster...

309
00:17:55,207 --> 00:17:57,175
no matter how long it takes.

310
00:17:57,276 --> 00:17:59,540
Besides, I'm getting kind of
used to wearing a kilt.

311
00:17:59,645 --> 00:18:03,581
[ Giggles ]
Can you believe I'm a size four? Whoo!

312
00:18:03,682 --> 00:18:04,944
- Ach.
- Aye.

313
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:06,950
Oh, it's pointless hunting for an animal...

314
00:18:07,052 --> 00:18:10,283
that has 2 4 miles of water to hide in.

315
00:18:10,389 --> 00:18:12,653
- Drain the lake.
- What?

316
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:15,955
You heard me.
Deploy the Delochinator.

317
00:18:17,563 --> 00:18:20,589
[ Groans ] Ooh!
[ Muttering ]

318
00:18:20,699 --> 00:18:24,999
Oh, pumping is hard.
[ Muttering ]

319
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:38,211
- We've lost our homes
and everything we hold dear.
- Aye.

320
00:18:41,353 --> 00:18:43,719
I see it! I see the monster!

321
00:18:45,824 --> 00:18:51,592
Nae! There's merely Loch Ness High School's
discarded homecoming float.

322
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:55,031
No way! Aberdeen rules!

323
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:59,002
[ Roaring ]

324
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:02,339
[ Screaming ]

325
00:19:02,441 --> 00:19:04,841
[Jingling ]

326
00:19:04,943 --> 00:19:08,071
- God, it's him!
- Come on, boys. Overpower it.

327
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:12,446
- ## [ Whistling ]
- Fine. I'll do it myself.

328
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:16,520
[ Grunting ]

329
00:19:16,622 --> 00:19:18,783
That was amazing, Mr. Burns!

330
00:19:18,891 --> 00:19:21,382
I was a little worried
when he swallowed me...

331
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:23,461
but, well, you know the rest.

332
00:19:23,562 --> 00:19:27,862
Ah. And now for my triumphant return
to Springfield.

333
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:36,967
Monster fever has gripped
Springfield by the throat.

334
00:19:37,075 --> 00:19:38,975
And it's all thanks to one man-

335
00:19:39,077 --> 00:19:43,446
Montgomery Burns has captured not only
a legendary monster, but also our hearts.

336
00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:46,074
And by the way, girls, he's single.

337
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:47,953
Single? Well, he passes the Selma test.

338
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,589
And now, presenting
the ninth wonder of the world-

339
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:01,825
the eighth being Gomer Pyle's
heavenly singing voice-

340
00:20:01,934 --> 00:20:05,028
I give you the Loch Ness Monster!

341
00:20:05,137 --> 00:20:07,264
- <i>##[ Fanfare ]</i>
- [ Cheering ]

342
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:10,273
- [ Chanting ] Monty! Monty!
- Thank you. You're too kind.

343
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:14,869
Yes, that's it. Let it all out.
Clutch me to your common bosom.

344
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:17,312
Hey, look.
He's getting up.

345
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:24,655
No, no. Stop it. Stop it.

346
00:20:24,756 --> 00:20:26,553
- <i>You'll enrage the beast.!</i>
- [ Cooing ]

347
00:20:26,658 --> 00:20:28,819
No pictures.
You're driving him mad!

348
00:20:31,663 --> 00:20:34,223
[ Shuddering ]

349
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:37,564
<i>Aah.! Stop it.!</i>
<i>You're blinding me.!</i>

350
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:40,069
Oh. Oh! I can't see.

351
00:20:40,172 --> 00:20:43,073
- Aah!
- [ Screams ]

352
00:20:43,175 --> 00:20:45,200
Run!

353
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:48,074
- Mr. Burns will kill us all!
- <i>[ Screaming ]</i>

354
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:51,439
Wait. Don't go.

355
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:54,678
Love me!

356
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:58,719
Well, if you wanted
people to love you...

357
00:20:58,824 --> 00:21:01,224
you sure blew it
with that insane rampage.

358
00:21:01,326 --> 00:21:03,226
- [ Sighs ]
- But you know what?

359
00:21:03,328 --> 00:21:05,592
To be loved,
you have to be nice to people...

360
00:21:05,697 --> 00:21:07,597
every day.

361
00:21:07,699 --> 00:21:10,532
But to be hated,
you don't have to do squat.

362
00:21:10,636 --> 00:21:12,536
You know, perhaps you're right.

363
00:21:12,638 --> 00:21:16,870
I got so swept up with the notion of being liked,
I completely forgot who I am.

364
00:21:16,975 --> 00:21:20,877
I'm a selfish old crank,
and that fits me like a Speedo.

365
00:21:20,979 --> 00:21:25,143
[ Cooing ]

366
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:28,583
So what do we do with our friend here?
Uh, throw him in the Dumpster?

367
00:21:28,687 --> 00:21:33,488
No, no, no. I really want to give
the lovable scamp a good home.

368
00:21:40,732 --> 00:21:42,700
- D'oh!
- Tough luck, Simpson.

369
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:45,964
- Come on, Nessie. One more pull.
- [ Roars ]

370
00:21:46,071 --> 00:21:49,131
Okay, okay.
Want a shrimp cocktail?

371
00:21:49,241 --> 00:21:52,438
- Nah.
- Yeah, they're not great.

372
00:21:52,544 --> 00:21:54,512
<i>##[ Bagpipes ]</i>

<i>##[ Ends ]</i>
