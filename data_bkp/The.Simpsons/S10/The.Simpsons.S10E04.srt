Oh, you look lovely this evening.

314
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:38,978
- Have you decreased in mass?
- <i>[ Marge Narrating ] I tried to resist...</i>

<i>but they applied powerful</i>
<i>mind-confusion techniques.</i>

Look! Behind you!

317
00:18:44,756 --> 00:18:48,419
- Insemination complete.
- Really? That seemed awfully quick.

318
00:18:48,527 --> 00:18:50,461
- What are you implying?
- Nothing. Nothing.

Whoa. Wow.
Look at the time.

Nine months later,
I gave birth to Maggie.

00:19:05,577 --> 00:19:08,774
And now she must return home
to Rigel VII...

325
00:19:08,881 --> 00:19:13,614
where she will be guaranteed
a lucrative civil service job for life.

326

Well, we can't compete with that, but-

- But nothing. Get your slime-less hands off her.
- [ Grunting ]

People! People! Space monsters.
This is going nowhere.

329
00:19:22,427 --> 00:19:25,624
There's only one man who can settle
an argument this bizarre.

It made me angry,Jerry.
Angry and tired.

334
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:42,874
Well, you're about to get
a whole lot angrier...

335
00:19:42,981 --> 00:19:45,506
because we have the extramarital
extraterrestrial backstage...

Ladies and gentlemen, meet Kang.

343
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:17,472
Yeah, I got a question
for that gross thing, whatever it is.

344
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:19,847
- Homer.
- Nah, the green dude.

345
00:20:19,952 --> 00:20:22,750
If you're that baby's daddy,
where you been at?

- <i>[ Audience Affirming ]</i>

You know, somebody needs to learn
your green ass some responsibility.

348
00:20:29,261 --> 00:20:31,786
- <i>[ Audience ] Yeah.!</i>
- [ Screams ]

349

Now hold on, Kang. You can't bully

[ Screaming ]

351
00:20:40,138 --> 00:20:42,106
And now for my final thought.

352
00:20:42,207 --> 00:20:46,268
Nobody wins when parents put their petty
squabbles above the welfare of a child.

353
00:20:46,378 --> 00:20:50,644
<i>Let's hope they put their differences aside</i>

<i>##[ Ends ]</i>

I can't believe it.
Jerry Springer didn't solve our conflict.

361
00:21:13,472 --> 00:21:18,000
- And now he's dead.
- Anyhoo, this is your last chance.

362
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:20,476
Turn over the baby now.

363
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:24,345
Or we will destroy all
your leaders in Washington.

Come on, Maggie.
Let's go home.
