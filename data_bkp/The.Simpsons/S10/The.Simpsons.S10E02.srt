All right! The museum's still open.

332
00:18:56,435 --> 00:18:59,302
- Why don't you like Edison that much?
- [ Grunts ]

333
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:04,676
- Hey, folks. Do you like riddles?
- [ Chattering ]

334
00:19:04,776 --> 00:19:06,767
Okay, then.

335
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:10,906
How many geniuses does it take
to invent a lightbulb?

336
00:19:12,518 --> 00:19:15,043
Just one: Thomas Edison.

337
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:19,682
- [ Laughter, Applause ]
- That's very good.

338
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:21,691
And that's true too.
It's funny and true.

339
00:19:21,793 --> 00:19:26,958
Now behind that door is
Edison's actual preserved brain.

340
00:19:27,065 --> 00:19:28,794
[ Gasping ]

341
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:32,667
Ordinarily, folks, tour groups are not
allowed to see it...

342
00:19:32,771 --> 00:19:36,707
- and, of course, today will be no exception.
- [ Groaning ]

343
00:19:36,808 --> 00:19:41,245
Now no tour would be complete without
a visit to Edison's boyhood gift shop.

344
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:44,804
[ Chattering ]

345
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:51,622
<i>[ Chattering Continues ]</i>

346
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:02,861
Now let's take care of business.

347
00:20:05,637 --> 00:20:07,537
Out of the way.

348
00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:10,733
This is one invention you're not
getting credit for, you inspiration hog.

349
00:20:10,842 --> 00:20:12,639
Your electric hammer, maestro?

350
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:18,372
Invent your way
out of this, Edison! Hmm?

351
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:22,319
<i>Hmm.</i>

352
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:30,290
<i>[ Gasps ] Look, Son.</i>
<i>Edison was just like me.</i>

353
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:31,953
You mean the wild mood swings?

354
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:36,364
No! We both lived
in another man's shadow.

355
00:20:36,468 --> 00:20:41,963
This old-timey nerd and I have suffered
the same frustration and heartache.

356
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:44,008
We're not rivals.

357
00:20:44,109 --> 00:20:48,443
We're just a couple of dreamers
who set the bar a little too high.

358
00:20:50,015 --> 00:20:53,143
- I can't destroy your work, my friend.
- Can I?

359
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:57,621
No, but we'll stop off at the da Vinci museum
on the way home.

360
00:20:57,723 --> 00:20:59,850
Uh, I think that's in Italy, Dad.

361
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:02,085
Oh. Well, then we'll take it out
on Eli Whitney.

362
00:21:02,194 --> 00:21:04,822
<i>Authorities say the phony pope...</i>

363
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:10,459
can be recognized by his high-top sneakers
and incredibly foul mouth.

364
00:21:10,569 --> 00:21:13,470
In other news, Thomas Edison,
the greatest inventor of all time-

365
00:21:13,572 --> 00:21:15,904
- [ Both Gasp ]
- is apparently still inventing...

366
00:21:16,008 --> 00:21:18,442
despite the notable handicap
of being dead.

367
00:21:18,543 --> 00:21:20,135
That's my Tommy!

368
00:21:20,245 --> 00:21:23,874
[ Brockman ] Two new Edison creations
have just been discovered in his museum.

369
00:21:23,982 --> 00:21:27,418
- A six-legged chair that won't tip over-
- [ Applause ]

370
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:30,113
and even more astounding,
an electric hammer.

371
00:21:30,222 --> 00:21:33,316
- <i>[ Applause ]</i>
- <i>[ Camera Shutters Clicking ]</i>

372
00:21:33,425 --> 00:21:35,791
That was your idea.

373
00:21:35,894 --> 00:21:39,125
This brilliant innovation is
expected to generate millions...

374
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:41,927
- for Edison's already-wealthy heirs.
- [ Laughing ]

375
00:21:42,034 --> 00:21:44,059
Dad, those should be your millions.

376
00:21:44,169 --> 00:21:46,967
I gotta admit, Homer.
You're takin' this pretty well.

377
00:21:47,072 --> 00:21:51,736
Let's just say
I'm sitting in the right chair.

378
00:22:38,557 --> 00:22:40,525
- [ Murmuring ]
- Shh!
