1
00:00:06,437 --> 00:00:08,513
And Maggie Makes Three

2
00:00:33,213 --> 00:00:36,914
We now return to
Knightboat: The Crime-Solving Boat.

3
00:00:37,134 --> 00:00:39,625
Faster, Knightboat.
Gotta catch those starfish poachers.

4
00:00:39,845 --> 00:00:42,170
Don't have to yell, Michael.
I'm all around you.

5
00:00:43,223 --> 00:00:45,346
Oh, no. They're headed for land.

6
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:52,646
- We'll never catch them now.
- Incorrect. Look, a canal.

7
00:00:52,858 --> 00:00:56,610
- Go, Knightboat, go.
- Every week, there's a canal.

8
00:00:56,236 --> 00:00:58,312
- Or an inlet.
- Or a fjord.

9
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:00,819
Quiet! I won't hear another word
against the boat.

10
00:01:00,991 --> 00:01:05,710
- Okay, TV off. It's family time.
- But, Marge...

11
00:01:05,287 --> 00:01:08,870
...Knightboat: The Crime-Solving Boat.

12
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:12,202
Homer, you promised,
one night of family time a week.

13
00:01:12,378 --> 00:01:15,581
Besides, that back-talking boat
sets a bad example.

14
00:01:15,798 --> 00:01:17,780
Says you, woman.

15
00:01:17,299 --> 00:01:19,700
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Mom.

16
00:01:19,218 --> 00:01:21,923
All right, family time begins now.

17
00:01:30,938 --> 00:01:32,480
- Homer.
- It was Bart.

18
00:01:32,648 --> 00:01:34,890
Why don't we all look
at the photo album.

19
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:37,240
So many memories.

20
00:01:37,194 --> 00:01:40,480
Oh, look, Knightboat.

21
00:01:42,658 --> 00:01:45,445
And here's our TV next to the mirror.

22
00:01:45,661 --> 00:01:47,737
It looks like we have two.

23
00:01:49,206 --> 00:01:50,369
- Two.
- Two.

24
00:01:50,541 --> 00:01:54,159
Yeah, yeah, two.
Let's get to the baby pictures.

25
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,712
- Mom.
- That's exciting.

26
00:01:56,922 --> 00:01:58,915
Oh, please.

27
00:02:03,137 --> 00:02:04,465
Here's Bart sleeping.

28
00:02:04,638 --> 00:02:06,298
Here he is dozing.

29
00:02:06,473 --> 00:02:09,308
Here he is after a visit
from the sandman.

30
00:02:09,476 --> 00:02:11,635
Here's nappy time, Bart.

31
00:02:11,812 --> 00:02:14,730
Here's a cute one.
He's all tuckered out.

32
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:17,312
Why aren't there any pictures
of Maggie?

33
00:02:17,985 --> 00:02:23,110
Well, I'm glad you asked.
It's actually a very interesting story.

34
00:02:24,116 --> 00:02:27,319
It all began about two years ago,
before Maggie was even born.

35
00:02:27,494 --> 00:02:30,680
Bart, you were Lisa's age.
And, Lisa...

36
00:02:30,247 --> 00:02:33,248
...you were the age Bart was
several years ago.

37
00:02:33,459 --> 00:02:36,329
Get the camera ready,
Bart very sleepy.

38
00:02:36,545 --> 00:02:39,360
Listen carefully, and my words
will shape images...

39
00:02:39,214 --> 00:02:40,922
...as clear as any TV show.

40
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:43,582
It was a tumultuous time
for our nation.

41
00:02:43,761 --> 00:02:46,927
The clear-beverage craze gave us all
a reason to live.

42
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:49,849
The information superhighway
showed the average person...

43
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,472
...what some nerd thinks
about Star Trek.

44
00:02:52,645 --> 00:02:57,141
And the domestication of the dog
continued unabated.

45
00:02:57,483 --> 00:02:59,938
I was at my workstation
when suddenly...

46
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:02,269
Attention, American workers.

47
00:03:02,488 --> 00:03:07,150
Your plant has been taken over by
an all-star team of freelance terrorists.

48
00:03:08,369 --> 00:03:10,990
Not on my shift!

49
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:21,169
No, you don't.

50
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:25,257
Simpson, 10, terrorists, 8.

51
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,131
- Homer, tell the story right.
- Okay.

52
00:03:35,229 --> 00:03:36,771
Homer, you should see a doctor.

53
00:03:36,939 --> 00:03:39,809
I don't think a healthy man
can make that kind of smell.

54
00:03:39,984 --> 00:03:41,442
Your paychecks, gentlemen.

55
00:03:45,155 --> 00:03:48,240
This is it.
With a single glorious check...

56
00:03:48,409 --> 00:03:51,694
...I'm finally completely out of debt.

57
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:01,372
Yes! With my bills paid off,
I can finally quit this lousy job.

58
00:04:01,547 --> 00:04:03,456
But, Homer, how you gonna
make a living?

59
00:04:03,674 --> 00:04:06,758
Don't worry about Homer J.
I've got a plan.

60
00:04:06,927 --> 00:04:11,139
- A plan that'll fix you good.
- Hey, what did we do?

61
00:04:11,348 --> 00:04:14,302
Sorry, that just slipped out.
I'll miss you.

62
00:04:14,518 --> 00:04:17,436
Did you hear me? I said, I quit, Monty.

63
00:04:17,604 --> 00:04:21,223
And since I quit,
I can do anything I want.

64
00:04:21,442 --> 00:04:22,722
Is that so?

65
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:26,528
Lovely desk.
It would be too bad if someone...

66
00:04:26,697 --> 00:04:30,529
...oh, I don't know,
didn't use a coaster!

67
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:35,162
Such a nice, tidy office.

68
00:04:35,331 --> 00:04:38,913
Maybe it's time you started
living like a pig!

69
00:04:40,753 --> 00:04:43,670
Oh, I hope I haven't upset you...

70
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:45,582
...bongo head!

71
00:04:49,261 --> 00:04:52,630
Oh, I should be resisting this,
but I'm paralyzed with rage...

72
00:04:52,806 --> 00:04:55,594
...and island rhythms.

73
00:04:55,768 --> 00:04:57,926
Go, Homer. Yeah. Yeah.

74
00:04:58,103 --> 00:05:00,475
Way to play the boss's head
like a bongo, Homer.

75
00:05:00,648 --> 00:05:02,391
He's getting a pretty good sound
out of that guy.

76
00:05:08,489 --> 00:05:11,406
That's for employing me
for eight years.

77
00:05:16,163 --> 00:05:18,203
And that is that.

78
00:05:18,374 --> 00:05:22,917
Goodbye, mind-numbing,
backbreaking labor forever.

79
00:05:23,128 --> 00:05:26,332
Hello, dream job in paradise.

80
00:05:30,511 --> 00:05:34,176
And now, the final phase of my plan.

81
00:05:38,268 --> 00:05:40,226
Barney, any chance
you can get me a job?

82
00:05:40,396 --> 00:05:45,354
Hey. Sure, Homer.
I told you, my uncle owns the place.

83
00:05:45,567 --> 00:05:48,901
- Hey, Uncle Al, can Homer have a job?
- Sure.

84
00:05:51,991 --> 00:05:53,948
- Barney, you're fired.
- Okay.

85
00:05:54,118 --> 00:05:56,270
Show up tomorrow. Bring three rags.

86
00:05:56,203 --> 00:05:57,946
Oh, and a change of pants.

87
00:05:58,163 --> 00:06:00,121
- Why?
- When it happens, you'll know.

88
00:06:02,209 --> 00:06:03,834
You're a pin monkey?

89
00:06:04,878 --> 00:06:07,500
Finally, I don't have to be ashamed
of my father's job.

90
00:06:07,673 --> 00:06:10,793
It's romantic, throwing off
the shackles of the workaday world...

91
00:06:10,968 --> 00:06:13,174
...and following a dream, of sorts.

92
00:06:13,387 --> 00:06:15,261
I don't know if it's such a good idea.

93
00:06:15,431 --> 00:06:17,257
Can we get by
on a pin monkey's salary?

94
00:06:17,433 --> 00:06:18,808
Don't worry, Marge.

95
00:06:18,976 --> 00:06:21,763
I've come up with
a perfectly balanced budget.

96
00:06:21,937 --> 00:06:26,266
There will be exactly enough money
for you, me, Bart and Lisa...

97
00:06:26,442 --> 00:06:29,630
...if we make a few small sacrifices.

98
00:06:32,197 --> 00:06:34,867
From now on,
we use regular toilet paper...

99
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:37,655
...not that fancy quilted kind.

100
00:06:39,496 --> 00:06:41,619
And only one of you kids
can go to college.

101
00:06:41,832 --> 00:06:43,326
- Fine.
- Fine.

102
00:06:44,877 --> 00:06:47,831
That night, your mom and I
went out for a romantic evening...

103
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,997
...to celebrate
the start of our new life.

104
00:06:50,174 --> 00:06:52,546
We began with dinner and dancing.

105
00:07:03,687 --> 00:07:07,560
Followed by a stroll on the beach.

106
00:07:12,321 --> 00:07:14,942
- Marge.
- Homer.

107
00:07:15,157 --> 00:07:17,778
I've got sand in my underpants.

108
00:07:17,993 --> 00:07:19,785
Me too. Let's go home.

109
00:07:40,808 --> 00:07:42,551
I love you, Marge.

110
00:07:42,726 --> 00:07:45,300
I love you too, Homie.

111
00:07:45,521 --> 00:07:49,388
Everything in our lives
is finally perfectly balanced.

112
00:07:49,566 --> 00:07:52,852
I hope things stay exactly
like this forever.

113
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:07,748
Did you have to be so graphic?

114
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:11,708
It's okay, Marge. They pave the way
for this kind of filth in school.

115
00:08:11,922 --> 00:08:14,810
Dad, were you excited
that Mom was pregnant?

116
00:08:14,299 --> 00:08:16,257
Actually, your mother
hadn't told me yet.

117
00:08:16,427 --> 00:08:19,878
At that time, I had no idea
Maggie even existed.

118
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:22,675
- Dad!
- Dad!

119
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:24,427
Hi, Maggie.

120
00:08:26,937 --> 00:08:30,520
So anyhow, back then
there was no way for me to know...

121
00:08:30,691 --> 00:08:32,648
...your mother was pregnant.

122
00:08:34,236 --> 00:08:35,814
Hey.

123
00:08:36,572 --> 00:08:40,356
Marge, you tie up the bathroom
every morning. I've gotta wash my hair.

124
00:08:40,576 --> 00:08:45,617
The next few weeks at my dream job
were like a wonderful waking coma.

125
00:08:48,542 --> 00:08:50,499
- Hey, Homer.
- Hi there, Homer.

126
00:08:50,669 --> 00:08:52,329
- Hi, Homer.
- Hi there, Homer.

127
00:08:52,504 --> 00:08:54,820
Hi.

128
00:08:57,134 --> 00:08:59,376
Bowling-fresh.

129
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:07,389
Urinal-fresh.

130
00:09:17,571 --> 00:09:22,233
Homer, did you polish your head
in the Shine-O Ball-O?

131
00:09:22,409 --> 00:09:24,817
- No.
- Okay, then.

132
00:09:26,789 --> 00:09:29,493
I slowly learned the intricate mysteries
of the alley...

133
00:09:29,667 --> 00:09:32,703
...like where the pins go
after they're knocked down.

134
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:55,856
I was in heaven.
If horseracing is the sport of kings...

135
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:57,770
...then surely, bowling...

136
00:09:57,945 --> 00:10:01,314
...is a very good sport as well.

137
00:10:01,532 --> 00:10:03,655
- Hey, great job, Homer.
- Thanks a lot, Homer.

138
00:10:03,826 --> 00:10:05,534
Hey, you're the best.

139
00:10:05,744 --> 00:10:10,905
I'm gonna make it after all

140
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:16,165
Congratulations, Mrs. Simpson.
You're pregnant.

141
00:10:18,299 --> 00:10:20,421
Am I to take it that this is...

142
00:10:21,218 --> 00:10:23,900
...an unwanted pregnancy?

143
00:10:23,178 --> 00:10:25,930
Oh, no, no. Not exactly.

144
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:29,100
It's just that I haven't told Homer yet.
With his new job...

145
00:10:29,184 --> 00:10:31,640
...I don't know how we'll
be able to afford this.

146
00:10:31,812 --> 00:10:36,225
Well, you know, a healthy baby
can bring upwards of $60,000.

147
00:10:36,442 --> 00:10:38,648
- What?!
- Of course, that was just a test.

148
00:10:38,819 --> 00:10:43,280
Had you reacted differently, why,
you'd be in jail right now. Simply a test.

149
00:10:45,159 --> 00:10:48,991
So in a few months, both of you
will have a brand-new brother or sister.

150
00:10:49,163 --> 00:10:51,701
- Been there, done that.
- I hope it's a girl.

151
00:10:51,915 --> 00:10:55,699
You know nothing about genetics, Lis.
It goes boy, girl, boy, girl.

152
00:10:55,878 --> 00:10:59,247
- You're worried about telling Dad.
- Why do you say that?

153
00:10:59,423 --> 00:11:01,961
Well, you've been in my room
for about four hours now.

154
00:11:02,134 --> 00:11:04,174
Hey, I'm just hanging.

155
00:11:12,311 --> 00:11:14,350
- Homie, I...
- Can't talk. Praying.

156
00:11:14,521 --> 00:11:18,733
Dear Lord, the gods have been good
to me, and I am thankful.

157
00:11:18,901 --> 00:11:23,112
For the first time in my life,
everything is absolutely perfect...

158
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,688
...just the way it is.

159
00:11:26,784 --> 00:11:29,357
So here's the deal:
You freeze everything as it is...

160
00:11:29,536 --> 00:11:31,328
...and I won't ask for anything more.

161
00:11:31,497 --> 00:11:35,310
If that is okay,
please give me absolutely no sign.

162
00:11:35,209 --> 00:11:39,954
Okay, deal. In gratitude, I present you
this offering of cookies and milk.

163
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:44,424
If you want me to eat them for you,
give me no sign. Thy will be done.

164
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:57,971
I've got to tell Homer about this baby
in just the right way...

165
00:11:58,148 --> 00:12:00,220
...and at just the right time.

166
00:12:00,192 --> 00:12:02,517
Until then, please keep this
to yourselves.

167
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:06,278
If he found out now, it would
probably destroy him, huh?

168
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:08,680
Oh, yes.

169
00:12:08,283 --> 00:12:09,659
- Gotta go.
- Gotta go.

170
00:12:09,827 --> 00:12:12,690
Wait a minute. Wait. I know that look.

171
00:12:12,246 --> 00:12:14,285
Now, promise you won't tell Homer.

172
00:12:14,498 --> 00:12:16,704
Oh, we promise we won't tell...

173
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:18,749
...Homer.

174
00:12:23,132 --> 00:12:26,200
Hello. Is this A. Aaronson?

175
00:12:26,176 --> 00:12:30,803
It might interest you to know that
Marge Simpson is pregnant again.

176
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:36,590
Just thought you'd like to know,
Mr. Zowkowski.

177
00:12:37,438 --> 00:12:41,518
There. Aaronson and Zowkowski
are the two biggest gossips in town.

178
00:12:41,692 --> 00:12:43,768
In an hour, everyone will know.

179
00:12:45,321 --> 00:12:50,397
Another perfect day in my perfect life
with my perfect job.

180
00:12:50,576 --> 00:12:53,327
Hey, just heard the news
over the squawk box.

181
00:12:53,495 --> 00:12:56,615
- That's nice work, Homer.
- Thank you. Thank you very much.

182
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:58,913
It is nice work.

183
00:12:59,626 --> 00:13:03,245
Oh, Mr. Simpson, I have just heard
about the little bundle of joy.

184
00:13:03,422 --> 00:13:06,873
- Congratulations, sir.
- It's true, the bundle is little...

185
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:10,510
...but I'm not in it for the money.

186
00:13:11,388 --> 00:13:14,555
Hey, Homer,
way to get Marge pregnant.

187
00:13:15,684 --> 00:13:18,389
This is getting very abstract,
but thank you...

188
00:13:18,562 --> 00:13:21,349
...I do enjoy working
at the bowling alley.

189
00:13:22,232 --> 00:13:26,147
Surprise! Baby shower.

190
00:13:26,362 --> 00:13:29,446
Baby shower?
You know I haven't told Homer yet.

191
00:13:29,615 --> 00:13:31,239
And he'll be home any minute.

192
00:13:31,408 --> 00:13:32,867
- Oh, really?
- Oh, really?

193
00:13:37,915 --> 00:13:40,157
Man, it's windy as hell out there.

194
00:13:40,376 --> 00:13:44,243
Hey, wait a minute.
What are all these presents?

195
00:13:44,463 --> 00:13:45,838
It looks like you're...

196
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,877
...showering Marge with gifts.

197
00:13:49,677 --> 00:13:54,890
With little, tiny baby-sized gifts.

198
00:13:54,765 --> 00:13:58,510
Well, I'll be in the tub.

199
00:13:58,686 --> 00:14:01,603
By the way, congratulations
on your new job, Homer.

200
00:14:01,814 --> 00:14:04,898
New job? Marge is pregnant?!

201
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:08,234
No!

202
00:14:11,907 --> 00:14:14,825
Dad, you really threw a tantrum
like a little sissy girl?

203
00:14:14,994 --> 00:14:16,322
Oh, just that one time.

204
00:14:16,495 --> 00:14:18,784
Actually, when I was
about to have Bart...

205
00:14:18,997 --> 00:14:20,990
You're pregnant?!

206
00:14:24,795 --> 00:14:27,840
And then when I told him
about Lisa...

207
00:14:27,297 --> 00:14:28,756
You're pregnant again?!

208
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:34,501
Who wouldn't be upset?

209
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:37,681
That new baby in your mother's womb
was a ticking time bomb...

210
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:41,160
...threatening to blow this family
eight ways from Sunday.

211
00:14:41,228 --> 00:14:43,636
- Where are you going?
- You can't expect a person...

212
00:14:43,814 --> 00:14:45,474
...to sit for 30 minutes straight.

213
00:14:45,649 --> 00:14:48,105
I'm gonna get a snack and maybe
go to the bathroom.

214
00:14:48,277 --> 00:14:52,321
I'll stay here, but I'm gonna think
about products I might like to purchase.

215
00:14:56,618 --> 00:14:58,326
I don't have that.

216
00:15:01,832 --> 00:15:03,291
You're pregnant.

217
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:07,664
We're gonna have to have a baby.
All our financial plans are ruined.

218
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:11,165
We're doomed. Doomed, I tells you!

219
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:16,460
- Bart, let your father tell the story.
- Yeah.

220
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:19,350
- Okay, but I know funny.
- Anyhoo...

221
00:15:20,601 --> 00:15:21,929
We're doomed!

222
00:15:22,102 --> 00:15:24,950
- Homer, you had a head.
- Check.

223
00:15:24,271 --> 00:15:26,596
And your bottom was a little bigger.

224
00:15:27,691 --> 00:15:29,814
You've worked hard
at the bowling alley.

225
00:15:29,985 --> 00:15:32,820
- Why don't you ask for a raise.
- Yeah, a raise.

226
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:35,568
I've never been good enough
at any job to deserve one.

227
00:15:35,741 --> 00:15:38,493
But I'm damn good at this one.
That's it.

228
00:15:38,661 --> 00:15:40,986
I'm gonna march
right up to Al and say:

229
00:15:41,205 --> 00:15:44,656
Steve. I mean, Al,
I think I deserve a raise.

230
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:47,366
You're a hard worker.
I'd like to give you a raise.

231
00:15:47,544 --> 00:15:51,163
But the alley just ain't doing enough
business to pay that kind of money.

232
00:15:51,382 --> 00:15:55,629
How about if I triple the business?
Then could I get a raise?

233
00:15:55,844 --> 00:15:57,636
Well, yeah, but...

234
00:16:22,454 --> 00:16:24,790
Of course.

235
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:27,744
Bowling. Bowling here.

236
00:16:27,918 --> 00:16:30,374
Come bowl now. Get your bowling.

237
00:16:30,546 --> 00:16:32,455
Who's ready? Bowling.

238
00:16:32,673 --> 00:16:35,450
Mom, make Dad tell the story right.

239
00:16:35,259 --> 00:16:37,335
That's what really happened.

240
00:16:38,178 --> 00:16:41,761
My marketing plan attracted a record
number of police and fire officials...

241
00:16:41,932 --> 00:16:45,348
...but few stayed to bowl. I failed.

242
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:49,848
Quitting my dream job
was the hardest thing I've ever done.

243
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,732
You did a great job, Homer.

244
00:16:51,942 --> 00:16:54,729
I'm really gonna miss you.
Place has never been cleaner.

245
00:16:54,903 --> 00:16:58,237
And the way you kept the young people
away, that was beautiful.

246
00:16:58,449 --> 00:17:00,157
Oh, yeah. Thanks for that.

247
00:17:00,367 --> 00:17:04,697
Anyway, we all pitched in, and we
got you this little going-away thing.

248
00:17:09,376 --> 00:17:12,128
This was the happiest time of my life.

249
00:17:12,296 --> 00:17:14,419
I'll never forget you guys.

250
00:17:14,590 --> 00:17:16,962
Especially you, Joey.

251
00:17:17,176 --> 00:17:19,548
- See you around, Mr. Homer.
- Don't worry, Joey.

252
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:22,258
We'll make it to California someday.

253
00:17:22,473 --> 00:17:24,964
Sure, we will, Mr. Homer.
Sure, we will.

254
00:17:27,353 --> 00:17:29,926
It's gonna be sad around here
without you, Homer.

255
00:17:30,105 --> 00:17:32,228
- Yeah.
- Sure is.

256
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:39,107
- Boy, this is depressing.
- I know what'd cheer us up. Bowling.

257
00:17:42,326 --> 00:17:44,484
Look at this, I got a ball here.

258
00:17:45,954 --> 00:17:48,446
- I feel happy now. Hey.
- Boy, this is fun.

259
00:17:48,665 --> 00:17:51,417
I needed more money to support
my growing family.

260
00:17:51,585 --> 00:17:56,580
And there was only one place in town
that a man like me could make it.

261
00:18:11,939 --> 00:18:14,477
Acid rain again.

262
00:18:30,582 --> 00:18:32,741
Yes? Are you a new applicant?

263
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,827
- I quit, and I came to get my job back.
- Through there.

264
00:18:45,598 --> 00:18:48,515
So come crawling back, eh?

265
00:18:48,726 --> 00:18:52,593
Seems like the classy thing to do
would be not to call attention to it.

266
00:18:52,813 --> 00:18:57,226
- Thanks for giving me my old job back.
- I'm afraid it's not that simple.

267
00:18:57,401 --> 00:18:59,275
As punishment for your desertion...

268
00:18:59,445 --> 00:19:03,193
...it's company policy
to give you the plague.

269
00:19:03,407 --> 00:19:05,115
Sir, that's the "plaque."

270
00:19:05,325 --> 00:19:08,492
Yes, the special
de-motivational plaque...

271
00:19:08,662 --> 00:19:11,414
...to break what's left of your spirit.

272
00:19:11,582 --> 00:19:15,793
Because, you see,
you're here forever.

273
00:19:18,505 --> 00:19:21,430
"Don't forget: You're here forever."

274
00:19:27,431 --> 00:19:30,432
I've never been so miserable
in all my life.

275
00:19:30,601 --> 00:19:32,926
But I can't take it out
on Marge and the kids.

276
00:19:33,103 --> 00:19:36,638
I've gotta carry the burden
all by myself.

277
00:19:38,192 --> 00:19:40,564
- Hi, honey. How are you?
- Well, actually...

278
00:19:40,736 --> 00:19:44,401
Oh, I can't go on with this charade.
I hate my job. I hate my life.

279
00:19:44,573 --> 00:19:47,657
Since I found out about this baby,
there's been only bad luck.

280
00:19:47,868 --> 00:19:50,157
My contractions started an hour ago.

281
00:19:50,371 --> 00:19:53,241
Just in one ear and out the other
with you, isn't it?

282
00:19:55,334 --> 00:19:58,667
This is incredible.
It's God's most wondrous miracle.

283
00:19:58,837 --> 00:20:01,245
Sir, I think your wife
wants to hold the baby.

284
00:20:01,423 --> 00:20:03,879
My wife? Where? Where?

285
00:20:05,511 --> 00:20:08,200
Congratulations. It's a boy.

286
00:20:09,306 --> 00:20:12,675
You're truly the catch of the day.

287
00:20:13,394 --> 00:20:16,395
It's wonderful. It's magical. Oh, boy.

288
00:20:16,563 --> 00:20:19,315
Here it comes, another mouth.

289
00:20:19,525 --> 00:20:21,601
One more push should do it.

290
00:20:21,777 --> 00:20:23,485
Marvelous.

291
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:31,112
Congratulations, Mr. Simpson.
You have a beautiful, healthy baby.

292
00:20:31,328 --> 00:20:33,784
Okay.

293
00:20:37,501 --> 00:20:40,122
Homie, I think someone
is saying hello.

294
00:20:40,337 --> 00:20:41,452
Hello.

295
00:20:43,632 --> 00:20:46,966
It's a boy. And what a boy!

296
00:20:47,761 --> 00:20:50,846
That's the umbilical cord. It's a girl.

297
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:56,510
A girl. Oh, Marge,
we have a wonderful baby girl.

298
00:20:56,228 --> 00:21:01,768
Not just a girl. The most beautiful
baby girl in the whole world.

299
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:06,394
Come on, Marge,
show a little enthusiasm.

300
00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:16,536
So you loved her right from the start.

301
00:21:18,417 --> 00:21:19,959
Absolutely.

302
00:21:20,169 --> 00:21:23,454
- Then why no pictures?
- Oh, there are pictures.

303
00:21:23,672 --> 00:21:26,757
I keep them where I need
the most cheering up.
