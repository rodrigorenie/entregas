1
00:00:07,896 --> 00:00:10,190
Fear of Flying

2
00:01:44,284 --> 00:01:47,950
Hey, Moe, you got change for a 5?

3
00:01:48,163 --> 00:01:50,370
Yeah, sure thing, Lenny.

4
00:01:52,501 --> 00:01:54,494
A snake in the cash register!

5
00:01:55,921 --> 00:01:57,961
Yeah, great prank, fellas. Great.

6
00:01:58,132 --> 00:02:02,461
- Oh, I'm gonna be sick tonight.
- Hey, Moe, you wanna smell my flower?

7
00:02:02,678 --> 00:02:04,600
Do I!

8
00:02:07,182 --> 00:02:08,842
I'm burning up here!

9
00:02:10,352 --> 00:02:13,570
Taking advantage
of my alcohol-soaked clothes.

10
00:02:14,231 --> 00:02:15,975
Oh, it's funny and it makes you think.

11
00:02:16,191 --> 00:02:21,670
I need some coffee before I black out.
Homer, pass me the sugar.

12
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,774
This is gonna be great.

13
00:02:27,161 --> 00:02:30,779
- Oh, there's sugar all over the bar now.
- That's not funny, Homer.

14
00:02:30,956 --> 00:02:36,330
Yeah. We were just messing around,
and you had to go too far.

15
00:02:36,253 --> 00:02:39,171
How many people want Homer
banned from this place for life?

16
00:02:39,381 --> 00:02:41,919
- Yeah!
- Come on, everybody.

17
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,100
This bar is like a tavern to me.

18
00:02:44,219 --> 00:02:47,968
Sorry, Homer. You should've thought of
that before giving me the sugar-me-do.

19
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:51,675
I'm taking your caricature down
from Mount Lushmore...

20
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:56,640
...and I'm pulling your favorite song
out of the jukebox.

21
00:02:56,273 --> 00:03:00,105
- "It's Raining Men"?
- Yeah, not no more it ain't.

22
00:03:08,285 --> 00:03:10,741
Joke's on them. I'm still alive.

23
00:03:13,207 --> 00:03:14,535
Cheer up, Homer.

24
00:03:14,708 --> 00:03:16,119
- Can't.
- Okay.

25
00:03:16,293 --> 00:03:19,800
What if you pretended
that this couch were a bar?

26
00:03:19,296 --> 00:03:22,167
Then you could spend more nights
at home with us.

27
00:03:22,341 --> 00:03:25,425
I am not going to dignify that
with an answer.

28
00:03:25,636 --> 00:03:27,110
Look on the bright side, Dad.

29
00:03:27,179 --> 00:03:29,468
Did you know the Chinese
use the same word for crisis...

30
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:33,554
...as they do for opportunity?
- Yes. "Cris-a-tunity."

31
00:03:33,727 --> 00:03:37,642
You're right. I've been wasting
my life away in that dump for years.

32
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:41,230
That's it. I'm going to find
a new bar to drink in.

33
00:03:41,193 --> 00:03:44,811
And I'm gonna get drunker
than I've ever been in my entire life.

34
00:03:44,989 --> 00:03:47,650
Bart, where's my wallet?

35
00:03:47,241 --> 00:03:49,399
- Right here, Dad.
- Thank you.

36
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,623
- Wow, classy.
- Good evening, sir.

37
00:03:58,836 --> 00:04:01,457
Would you please leave
without a fuss right now?

38
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:03,955
Okay.

39
00:04:09,221 --> 00:04:12,800
This looks like a nice, friendly place.

40
00:04:12,224 --> 00:04:15,260
Sammy, you're too old
to go on a date with two twins...

41
00:04:15,436 --> 00:04:19,101
...on the same night you're supposed to
marry Diane without Rebecca knowing.

42
00:04:19,273 --> 00:04:23,317
I'll make you a bet. If this affects my
major-league comeback, I'll sell the bar.

43
00:04:23,527 --> 00:04:25,401
Woody, give me a beer.

44
00:04:25,612 --> 00:04:27,854
I think you've had enough,
Mr. Peterson.

45
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,320
My chiropractor says
I can't carry you home anymore.

46
00:04:31,201 --> 00:04:34,535
Just give me another beer,
you brain-dead hick.

47
00:04:34,705 --> 00:04:36,781
I'll kill you. I'll kill all of you!

48
00:04:36,957 --> 00:04:40,291
Settle down, Normie.
Gotta save those pipes for karaoke.

49
00:04:43,714 --> 00:04:46,300
I love you guys.

50
00:04:55,684 --> 00:04:57,226
Wait a minute.

51
00:04:57,394 --> 00:05:00,810
There's something bothering me
about this place.

52
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:05,981
I know. This lesbian bar
doesn't have a fire exit!

53
00:05:06,153 --> 00:05:10,732
- Enjoy your deathtrap, ladies.
- What was her problem?

54
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:16,826
Greetings, good man.
Might I trouble you for a drink?

55
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:20,989
- Oh, get out of here, Homer.
- Homer? Who is Homer?

56
00:05:21,168 --> 00:05:24,390
My name is Guy Incognito.

57
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:34,839
Oh, my God.
This man is my exact double.

58
00:05:35,265 --> 00:05:38,101
That dog has a puffy tail!

59
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:43,270
Here, Puff. Here, Puff.

60
00:05:46,485 --> 00:05:48,228
The last bar in Springfield.

61
00:05:48,404 --> 00:05:51,773
If they don't let me in here,
I'm gonna have to quit drinking.

62
00:05:52,616 --> 00:05:54,241
Shut up, liver!

63
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:56,905
My liver hurts.

64
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:05,415
- I'd like a beer, please.
- Sorry, you gotta be a pilot to drink here.

65
00:06:05,587 --> 00:06:08,161
- But I am a pilot.
- Where's your uniform?

66
00:06:08,966 --> 00:06:11,801
I stowed it safely
in the overhead compartment.

67
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:16,423
- Well, you talk the talk. Here's a loaner.
- We need a pilot, pronto.

68
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,800
- Who wants to fly to the Windy City?
- I'll go! Me! I'm your man!

69
00:06:21,228 --> 00:06:22,603
Conditions are a bit windy.

70
00:06:22,813 --> 00:06:24,936
Well, on second thought,
maybe I'll sit down.

71
00:06:25,107 --> 00:06:26,981
- You.
- But I...

72
00:06:27,151 --> 00:06:30,733
You're not just impersonating
a pilot so you can drink here, are you?

73
00:06:30,904 --> 00:06:34,523
Yeah. That's exactly why I'm here.

74
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,989
You flyboys. You crack me up.

75
00:06:37,202 --> 00:06:39,658
But I keep telling you, I'm not a pilot.

76
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:42,403
And I keep telling you
you flyboys crack me up!

77
00:06:42,624 --> 00:06:46,207
- Hi, I'm Alan. I'm your copilot.
- Yeah...

78
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,581
As a change of pace...

79
00:06:48,756 --> 00:06:52,588
...I'm gonna let you do most of the
work. I think you're ready for it, Alan.

80
00:06:54,136 --> 00:06:57,470
And I'll just get us started.

81
00:07:00,517 --> 00:07:02,806
We'll need that to live.

82
00:07:09,818 --> 00:07:15,239
If word gets out about this, Crazy Clown
Airlines will be a laughingstock.

83
00:07:15,449 --> 00:07:17,270
In exchange for your silence...

84
00:07:17,201 --> 00:07:21,198
...I'm prepared to offer your family free
tickets to anywhere in the United States.

85
00:07:21,372 --> 00:07:23,530
Excluding Alaska and Hawaii,
the freak states.

86
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,705
Good news, everybody.
Because I endangered lives...

87
00:07:27,878 --> 00:07:29,420
...we can fly anywhere we want.

88
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:30,910
- Alaska!
- Hawaii!

89
00:07:32,299 --> 00:07:33,877
I don't know, Homer.

90
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:36,803
We're right in the middle
of the busy housekeeping season.

91
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,132
But, Marge, you deserve a vacation.

92
00:07:40,307 --> 00:07:43,890
It's a chance for you to clean up
after us in a whole other state.

93
00:07:44,103 --> 00:07:48,646
But getting on a plane like that seems
like a hassle coupled with a burden.

94
00:07:48,857 --> 00:07:52,108
Come on, Marge. I wanna shake off
the dust of this one-horse town.

95
00:07:52,277 --> 00:07:55,729
I wanna explore the world. I wanna
watch TV in a different time zone.

96
00:07:55,906 --> 00:07:59,655
I wanna visit strange, exotic malls.
I'm sick of eating hoagies.

97
00:07:59,827 --> 00:08:04,323
I want a grinder, a sub, a footlong hero.
I wanna live, Marge!

98
00:08:04,498 --> 00:08:08,662
Won't you let me live?
Won't you, please?

99
00:08:14,466 --> 00:08:17,716
So, Marge, pretty sweet, eh?

100
00:08:17,886 --> 00:08:20,294
Oh, I forgot to clean
the lint basket in the dryer.

101
00:08:20,472 --> 00:08:23,841
If someone broke into the house
and did laundry, it could start a fire.

102
00:08:25,436 --> 00:08:31,308
Oh, great. I specifically asked
not to be seated next to a baby.

103
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:36,362
We must be really flying high.

104
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:40,290
Those people down there
look all tiny and blurry.

105
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,407
Just like the inside of a cataract.

106
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:43,948
Attention, passengers.

107
00:08:44,121 --> 00:08:49,790
Due to our policy of overselling flights,
this flight has been oversold.

108
00:08:49,293 --> 00:08:51,416
In accordance with FAA rules...

109
00:08:51,587 --> 00:08:56,249
...the first two people to the front
will be upgraded to first class.

110
00:08:59,511 --> 00:09:01,540
Okay, you two.

111
00:09:01,263 --> 00:09:03,422
Come on, Bart,
they're gonna pamper us.

112
00:09:04,224 --> 00:09:06,466
Not literally, of course.

113
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,230
I come for the service...

114
00:09:14,401 --> 00:09:18,351
...but I stay for the legroom.

115
00:09:21,575 --> 00:09:24,362
Flight crew, prepare for takeoff.

116
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:30,115
I think I'll go get a picture
of the plane taking off.

117
00:09:30,292 --> 00:09:33,744
Marge, what's wrong?
Are you hungry? Sleepy? Gassy?

118
00:09:33,921 --> 00:09:39,128
- Gassy? Is it gas? It's gas, isn't it?
- Homer, I never told you this before...

119
00:09:39,301 --> 00:09:41,757
...but I'm not a good flier.

120
00:09:45,557 --> 00:09:48,594
I have to get off the plane.
Let me off the plane.

121
00:09:48,811 --> 00:09:51,847
I'm asking you nicely
to open the doors.

122
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,899
Take it easy, Marge.
How about if we dope you up real good?

123
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:57,605
Let me off! Let me off! Let me off!

124
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:08,111
It's okay, Marge,
we don't need to go on a trip.

125
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:12,198
We'll just wait for the killer bees
to come to us.

126
00:10:18,215 --> 00:10:21,133
You know, I have this feeling
that we forgot something.

127
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,933
- I'm sure it's nothing.
- Mom, are you feeling any better?

128
00:10:30,102 --> 00:10:34,811
- Yes, but I'd rather not talk about it.
- Permit me to solve the mystery.

129
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,933
Your mother has a fear of flying.

130
00:10:37,151 --> 00:10:40,484
So much for the days when I could say,
"At least my mother's normal."

131
00:10:40,654 --> 00:10:43,904
- Everybody's got a fear of something.
- Not everybody.

132
00:10:44,116 --> 00:10:46,987
- Sock puppets.
- Where?! Where?!

133
00:10:47,161 --> 00:10:49,402
Mom, are you sure
you don't want to discuss it?

134
00:10:49,621 --> 00:10:52,112
Sure as sugar.

135
00:10:55,850 --> 00:11:00,424
Lisa, the important thing is for your
mother to repress what happened...

136
00:11:00,591 --> 00:11:05,169
...push it deep down inside her
so she'll never annoy us again.

137
00:11:05,346 --> 00:11:07,718
If we don't encourage her
to vent her feelings...

138
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:09,598
...they can come out in other ways.

139
00:11:09,767 --> 00:11:12,851
I just realized we never had
a wedding for the cat and the dog.

140
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:15,350
They've been living in sin.

141
00:11:25,199 --> 00:11:27,275
Mom, you've been cooking all night?

142
00:11:27,493 --> 00:11:31,193
Judge, jury and executioner
all rolled into one, you are.

143
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:33,953
See, Dad?
I told you Mom would have problems.

144
00:11:34,124 --> 00:11:38,585
No, no, honey, it's all right.
Really, I'm fine. I'm all right.

145
00:11:38,754 --> 00:11:42,880
Mother always said don't complain.
Be good. Behave. Behave.

146
00:11:42,257 --> 00:11:45,128
Be nice. Smile. Be polite.
Don't make waves.

147
00:11:45,302 --> 00:11:49,596
You heard your mother's ramblings.
She's fine, so behave.

148
00:11:54,478 --> 00:11:57,396
Marge, it's 3 a.m.

149
00:11:57,564 --> 00:12:01,183
- Shouldn't you be baking?
- In a little while.

150
00:12:03,195 --> 00:12:04,523
Mom, can we talk to you?

151
00:12:04,697 --> 00:12:08,112
Can't talk. Keeping myself
in a state of catlike readiness.

152
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:11,340
Neat.

153
00:12:11,245 --> 00:12:13,534
Anyway, Mom,
maybe you should go into therapy.

154
00:12:13,747 --> 00:12:16,951
No, I don't need therapy.
I'm fine. And it's too expensive.

155
00:12:17,167 --> 00:12:19,741
And I don't believe in it.
It breaks up families.

156
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,289
It turns wives against husbands,
children against fathers...

157
00:12:23,465 --> 00:12:24,794
...neighbors against me.

158
00:12:24,967 --> 00:12:28,550
You don't have to pay some
fancy psychiatrist 10 bucks an hour...

159
00:12:28,721 --> 00:12:30,594
...to get top-notch therapy.

160
00:12:30,806 --> 00:12:32,680
Hello. Radio Psychic.

161
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:35,767
You will die a terrible, terrible death.

162
00:12:35,936 --> 00:12:38,557
I'm sorry. That was our last caller.

163
00:12:38,731 --> 00:12:40,854
Okay, I'm getting something now.

164
00:12:41,775 --> 00:12:44,776
Okay. You will die
a terrible, terrible death.

165
00:12:44,945 --> 00:12:47,210
- But...
- Thank you for calling Radio Psychic.

166
00:12:47,197 --> 00:12:49,523
- Do you have a song request?
- "It's Raining Men."

167
00:12:51,744 --> 00:12:53,452
Now, Marge, "Dear Abby" says...

168
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:56,705
...seeing films about air travel
can calm your fears.

169
00:12:56,874 --> 00:12:58,701
Here are some upbeat titles.

170
00:12:58,917 --> 00:13:01,373
Hero. Fearless.

171
00:13:01,545 --> 00:13:03,205
Alive!

172
00:13:03,422 --> 00:13:06,957
No thanks to the plane,
many of us are still...

173
00:13:07,134 --> 00:13:09,423
...alive!
- Alive!

174
00:13:09,595 --> 00:13:11,671
We certainly are.

175
00:13:12,681 --> 00:13:14,804
Pass me another hunk of copilot.

176
00:13:14,975 --> 00:13:16,600
Dad, Mom's getting worse.

177
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:20,179
You have to take her to see a real
psychiatrist. Look how tense she is.

178
00:13:20,397 --> 00:13:21,939
She's fine.

179
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:32,741
All right, Lisa, you got your way.
Your mom's going to a psychiatrist.

180
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:35,864
She's gonna tell Marge to leave me.
It'll break up the family.

181
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:38,743
You'll have to live with
your grandmother and pick beans.

182
00:13:38,916 --> 00:13:40,825
Dad, I like picking beans
with Grandma.

183
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:43,671
- Well, keep it up, then.
- Okay, I will.

184
00:13:43,837 --> 00:13:46,209
- Good. You do that.
- Fine.

185
00:13:46,382 --> 00:13:50,545
- You'll be picking many a bean.
- Hope I do.

186
00:13:51,595 --> 00:13:54,300
I don't believe it! Principal Skinner.

187
00:13:54,515 --> 00:13:55,843
Well, well, well.

188
00:13:57,726 --> 00:14:01,344
- I never thought I'd win this easy.
- This has nothing to do with you.

189
00:14:01,563 --> 00:14:05,561
I have many, many issues
with my beloved smother... Mother.

190
00:14:05,776 --> 00:14:08,650
Leave that man alone
with his pain and sit down.

191
00:14:08,237 --> 00:14:09,731
Okay.

192
00:14:13,492 --> 00:14:15,319
All right, how much do you charge?

193
00:14:15,536 --> 00:14:18,157
If money is a problem,
I charge on a sliding scale.

194
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:20,287
I can go as low as $30 an hour.

195
00:14:20,499 --> 00:14:23,251
- Keep sliding.
- Thirty dollars will be fine.

196
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,162
First, what are your qualifications?

197
00:14:27,381 --> 00:14:29,410
Well...

198
00:14:29,675 --> 00:14:32,842
Oh, no.
I'm not here to take a reading test.

199
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,218
I wanna see some credentials.

200
00:14:35,431 --> 00:14:38,882
I'm sorry, doctor. He's just afraid
you'll blame all my problems on him.

201
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:40,886
I'm not here to blame anyone.

202
00:14:43,147 --> 00:14:46,101
Marge, therapy can be
an intense process.

203
00:14:46,317 --> 00:14:48,190
We'll go deep into your subconscious...

204
00:14:48,402 --> 00:14:54,606
...and we're not going to stop until we've
exposed the root of your fear of flying.

205
00:14:55,868 --> 00:14:58,573
Don't worry.
This is a private sanctuary...

206
00:14:58,787 --> 00:15:02,951
...where whatever transpires
will be just between us.

207
00:15:03,709 --> 00:15:07,420
Oh, that's just Murray the window
washer. He comes every day at 12:00.

208
00:15:07,212 --> 00:15:10,379
But it's a few seconds before 12:00.

209
00:15:18,724 --> 00:15:21,559
Ever since you started therapy,
all you can do is talk about yourself.

210
00:15:21,727 --> 00:15:23,554
Well, what about me, Marge?

211
00:15:23,771 --> 00:15:26,937
I just left my first session.
I haven't even opened my mouth yet.

212
00:15:27,149 --> 00:15:30,814
You see? You see?
"I just left my first session...

213
00:15:30,986 --> 00:15:34,355
...and I haven't opened
my mouth yet."

214
00:15:34,573 --> 00:15:37,907
Marge, there's no simple explanation
for your fear of flying...

215
00:15:38,118 --> 00:15:41,119
...but it can probably be traced
to some childhood trauma.

216
00:15:41,288 --> 00:15:42,617
Think back.

217
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:46,704
What's the earliest memory you have
of something bad happening?

218
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:51,337
That would have to be
my first day of school.

219
00:15:52,508 --> 00:15:55,924
They got this thing called a fire drill.

220
00:15:56,950 --> 00:15:59,677
They use it to drill a flaming hole
in your head.

221
00:16:01,642 --> 00:16:07,929
And there's only one big toilet, and they
make you all go at the same time.

222
00:16:09,233 --> 00:16:12,684
The kids at school were even worse.

223
00:16:18,492 --> 00:16:20,366
You like the Monkees?

224
00:16:20,536 --> 00:16:22,575
You know they don't write
their own songs.

225
00:16:22,746 --> 00:16:25,498
- They do so.
- They don't play their own instruments.

226
00:16:25,708 --> 00:16:27,581
No! No!

227
00:16:27,793 --> 00:16:30,350
That's not even
Michael Nesmith's real hat.

228
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:34,662
- Kids can be so cruel.
- But it's true.

229
00:16:34,842 --> 00:16:37,878
They didn't write their own songs
or play their own instruments.

230
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:40,129
The Monkees
weren't about music, Marge.

231
00:16:40,347 --> 00:16:43,597
They were about rebellion,
about political and social upheaval.

232
00:16:46,478 --> 00:16:49,812
- Did you talk about me in therapy today?
- I don't think so.

233
00:16:49,982 --> 00:16:51,476
Tell me the truth!

234
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:54,568
Don't tell her I raised my voice. Don't.

235
00:16:54,903 --> 00:16:56,777
Happy family. Happy family.

236
00:16:56,989 --> 00:17:00,109
I keep having the same dream.

237
00:17:00,284 --> 00:17:04,328
I'm the mother from Lost in Space.

238
00:17:04,538 --> 00:17:06,246
Ready for breakfast, Dr. Smith?

239
00:17:06,415 --> 00:17:08,573
Oh, being stuck
on this godforsaken planet...

240
00:17:08,751 --> 00:17:11,917
...has vanquished
what little appetite I had.

241
00:17:14,631 --> 00:17:20,551
Warning! Warning!
Dr. Smith refuses to do his astro-chores.

242
00:17:20,721 --> 00:17:23,177
Why, you clattering clank of cogs and...

243
00:17:23,349 --> 00:17:26,184
My dear lady, as you well know,
my back is a disaster area.

244
00:17:26,352 --> 00:17:28,391
D'oh, the pain! D'oh, the pain of it all!

245
00:17:28,604 --> 00:17:33,147
Danger! Danger!
My hooks are flailing wildly.

246
00:17:36,278 --> 00:17:40,525
Wait! Daddy, wait! Please don't leave!

247
00:17:40,699 --> 00:17:42,692
Take me with you!

248
00:17:43,118 --> 00:17:47,864
Marge, are you aware you just said
"Please don't leave" to your daddy?

249
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,664
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

250
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:52,241
And you also infringed
on any number of copyrights.

251
00:17:53,379 --> 00:17:56,830
Now, let's talk about your father.

252
00:17:56,298 --> 00:17:58,172
Sure, okay. I'll talk about Father.

253
00:17:58,342 --> 00:18:01,343
Father Christmas. That's what
they call Santa Claus in England.

254
00:18:01,512 --> 00:18:05,940
They drive on the wrong side
of the road there. Now, that's crazy.

255
00:18:05,265 --> 00:18:08,966
People always say how small England is,
but you couldn't fit it all in here.

256
00:18:09,144 --> 00:18:12,513
Not by a long shot.
You know what, I'm cured.

257
00:18:13,232 --> 00:18:15,687
Marge, get back here
and tell me about your father.

258
00:18:16,151 --> 00:18:19,686
- What did he do for a living?
- Okay.

259
00:18:19,863 --> 00:18:22,437
Okay, but you're gonna make
a big deal out of this.

260
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:27,286
- He was a pilot.
- A pilot? This is a big deal.

261
00:18:27,454 --> 00:18:29,328
You see?

262
00:18:29,498 --> 00:18:33,330
Marge, this may not be
the best time to bring this up...

263
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:36,377
...but your last check bounced.
- Wait, I'm remembering something.

264
00:18:36,589 --> 00:18:39,922
- Yes, Marge, there's still the matter of...
- I was a little girl...

265
00:18:43,637 --> 00:18:47,717
Goodbye, Margie. Be a good girl, now.

266
00:18:47,933 --> 00:18:51,384
- Why does Daddy have to leave?
- Because he's a pilot.

267
00:18:51,604 --> 00:18:56,396
- He flies all over the world.
- I wanna see Daddy fly.

268
00:18:56,608 --> 00:18:59,645
Margie! No, come back!

269
00:19:01,363 --> 00:19:03,735
Daddy? Daddy, where are you? Dad...?

270
00:19:03,907 --> 00:19:06,149
So who wants preflight cookie?

271
00:19:06,327 --> 00:19:09,162
- Fig Newtons? Hydrox?
- Daddy?

272
00:19:11,582 --> 00:19:15,959
Don't look at me! Don't look at me!

273
00:19:20,883 --> 00:19:23,670
My father was a stewardess.

274
00:19:23,844 --> 00:19:27,940
Marge, there's nothing
to be ashamed of here.

275
00:19:27,306 --> 00:19:32,510
Today male flight attendants,
or stewards, are common.

276
00:19:32,227 --> 00:19:34,540
- They are?
- Yes.

277
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:38,518
Thanks to trailblazers like your father.
You might say he was a pioneer.

278
00:19:38,734 --> 00:19:40,620
Yeah.

279
00:19:40,235 --> 00:19:42,691
You might even say
he was an American hero.

280
00:19:42,905 --> 00:19:44,364
Let's not go nuts.

281
00:19:44,531 --> 00:19:47,568
The important thing
is that we've pinpointed...

282
00:19:47,743 --> 00:19:52,370
...the precise moment when
you developed your fear of flying.

283
00:19:52,247 --> 00:19:54,821
Wait, some other stuff
is coming back to me.

284
00:19:56,251 --> 00:19:58,125
Open wide.

285
00:19:58,295 --> 00:20:02,440
Here comes the airplane.

286
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:16,140
This is what a corn field
looks like, honey.

287
00:20:20,651 --> 00:20:24,351
You think those things could also
have contributed to my fear of flying?

288
00:20:24,571 --> 00:20:29,150
- Yes, yes. It's all a rich tapestry.
- Oh, thank you. You've changed my life.

289
00:20:29,326 --> 00:20:31,698
We've really just begun
to scratch the surface.

290
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:34,408
There's still the serious problem
of your husband.

291
00:20:34,581 --> 00:20:37,369
That's okay. You don't have
to make her into a superwoman.

292
00:20:37,584 --> 00:20:40,870
- She can get on the plane, that's plenty.
- Thank you, doctor.

293
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,377
Whenever the wind whistles
through the leaves...

294
00:20:43,549 --> 00:20:47,499
...I'll think, "Lowenstein. Lowenstein."

295
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:50,674
- My name is Zweig.
- Lowenstein...

296
00:20:58,689 --> 00:21:03,896
Don't worry about a thing, honey.
I'm gonna help you through this.

297
00:21:05,904 --> 00:21:08,442
Those are all normal noises.

298
00:21:08,615 --> 00:21:12,399
Luggage compartment closing.
Cross-checking.

299
00:21:12,578 --> 00:21:15,911
Just sit back and relax.

300
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:21,908
That's just the engine powering up.

301
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:26,370
That's just the engine struggling.

302
