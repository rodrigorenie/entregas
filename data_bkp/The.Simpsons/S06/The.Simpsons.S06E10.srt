1
00:00:07,578 --> 00:00:09,154
Grampa vs. Sexual Inadequacy

2
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:34,496
We now return to the 1971 film...

3
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,954
...Goodtime Slim, Uncle Doobie,
and the Great Frisco FreakOut...

4
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:40,623
...starring Troy McClure.

5
00:00:43,881 --> 00:00:46,630
Slim, if we've got the bag
with the stolen diamonds...

6
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:49,122
...then what happened to the bag
with our stash?

7
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:51,705
There's more than one way
to get high, baby.

8
00:01:01,011 --> 00:01:03,844
Please, Marge. How often
can I see a movie of this caliber...

9
00:01:04,012 --> 00:01:06,714
...on late night TV?
- Is there something wrong, Homie?

10
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:09,335
It's just that I've only seen this
twice before...

11
00:01:09,514 --> 00:01:12,133
...and I've seen you every night
for the last 11 ye...

12
00:01:12,307 --> 00:01:15,009
What I meant to say is,
we'll snuggle tomorrow, sweetie.

13
00:01:15,182 --> 00:01:16,639
I promise.

14
00:01:23,352 --> 00:01:25,224
Enchiladas.

15
00:01:33,105 --> 00:01:34,218
Mom! Dad!

16
00:01:34,438 --> 00:01:36,393
Don't turn on the light!

17
00:01:36,606 --> 00:01:39,640
There's a UFO outside my window.
Seriously.

18
00:01:39,857 --> 00:01:43,638
Oh, Bart, it's just an old golf umbrella
stuck in a tree.

19
00:01:45,108 --> 00:01:47,857
Can I sleep in there
with you guys tonight?

20
00:01:48,067 --> 00:01:49,441
- No.
- Can I sit on the roof...

21
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:51,316
...with a baseball bat
in case a UFO comes?

22
00:01:51,527 --> 00:01:53,068
Yes, that's fine. Good, good.

23
00:01:56,278 --> 00:01:58,849
I hope you kept
the Homie fires burning.

24
00:02:00,613 --> 00:02:03,944
- Homer! Homer, wake up. Wake up.
- What?

25
00:02:04,156 --> 00:02:08,779
We need to talk about the marital
difficulties we've been having lately.

26
00:02:08,991 --> 00:02:10,816
Marge, there's just too much pressure.

27
00:02:10,991 --> 00:02:13,112
What with my job, the kids,
traffic snarls...

28
00:02:13,284 --> 00:02:15,156
...political strife at home and abroad.

29
00:02:15,326 --> 00:02:20,565
But I promise you the second all those
things go away, we'll have sex.

30
00:02:20,744 --> 00:02:24,240
I simply can't wait that long.
Maybe we should get some help.

31
00:02:24,412 --> 00:02:26,533
- How about a book?
- Okay.

32
00:02:26,746 --> 00:02:28,239
A tasteful book.

33
00:02:28,455 --> 00:02:30,280
Oh, all right.

34
00:02:44,918 --> 00:02:47,205
Hey, Marge, this guy looks like Apu!

35
00:02:47,711 --> 00:02:50,496
I don't want people to see us
looking at these books.

36
00:02:51,837 --> 00:02:53,116
What you looking at?

37
00:02:53,963 --> 00:02:55,539
I'm just reading up on artillery.

38
00:02:56,964 --> 00:02:59,287
Yes, and I'm pursuing my interest in...

39
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,961
This one's a good choice
and it's not smutty.

40
00:03:03,132 --> 00:03:04,838
It's a book on tape by Paul Harvey.

41
00:03:05,008 --> 00:03:08,670
That Midwestern man on the radio
who's like a pleasant version of Grampa.

42
00:03:08,884 --> 00:03:12,795
Mr. And Mrs. Erotic American.

43
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:14,337
Mom, Dad, look!

44
00:03:14,511 --> 00:03:17,130
This biography of Peter Uebberoth
is only 99 cents.

45
00:03:17,303 --> 00:03:21,593
- And I found the new Al Gore book.
- Sane Planning, Sensible Tomorrow.

46
00:03:21,763 --> 00:03:23,837
I hope it's as exciting
as his other book:

47
00:03:24,014 --> 00:03:25,886
Rational Thinking,
Reasonable Future.

48
00:03:26,056 --> 00:03:27,513
I'm getting this book on UFOs.

49
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:30,217
Did you know they're real?

50
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:32,297
But there's a conspiracy
to cover it up.

51
00:03:32,474 --> 00:03:35,757
Oh, that's just a paranoid fantasy.

52
00:03:55,065 --> 00:03:58,265
Mr. Vice President, someone finally
bought a copy of your book.

53
00:03:58,482 --> 00:04:00,971
Well, this calls for a celebration.

54
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:05,269
Celebrate good times
Come on!

55
00:04:05,485 --> 00:04:07,275
I will.

56
00:04:09,111 --> 00:04:11,398
Hello, Americans. Paul Harvey here.

57
00:04:11,736 --> 00:04:16,275
Did you know every good American
is at heart an erotic American?

58
00:04:16,446 --> 00:04:18,069
It's true.

59
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:19,565
A famous couple...

60
00:04:19,739 --> 00:04:22,773
I don 't need to tell you it was
Dwight and Mamie Eisenhower.

61
00:04:22,948 --> 00:04:24,986
- Offered this advice:

62
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,273
"Double your pleasure with a bath...

63
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:28,480
...together."

64
00:04:31,826 --> 00:04:34,860
Homie, I can't quite fit.

65
00:04:35,035 --> 00:04:37,488
The faucet's jammed into my back.

66
00:04:37,661 --> 00:04:38,988
I'm stuck.

67
00:04:39,745 --> 00:04:41,072
So am I.

68
00:04:47,581 --> 00:04:49,287
- Kids?
- Kids?

69
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:51,079
- Kids?
- Kids?

70
00:04:52,124 --> 00:04:54,909
A romantic vacation
can provide titillation.

71
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:58,657
Sensual, sanitary seclusion
awaits you at any of America 's fine...

72
00:04:58,834 --> 00:05:01,583
...AAA-approved motor lodges.

73
00:05:06,587 --> 00:05:08,329
The Arabian Nights Room looks nice.

74
00:05:08,712 --> 00:05:11,710
The Pharaoh's Chamber
has a vibrating sarcophagus.

75
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,962
Sorry there, Fred and Ethel.
Should have made a reservation.

76
00:05:15,131 --> 00:05:17,418
We only got one room left.

77
00:05:17,632 --> 00:05:20,381
The toilet is overflowing
in the Caveman Room.

78
00:05:24,259 --> 00:05:28,882
Oh, here we are. The Utility Room.

79
00:05:31,594 --> 00:05:34,509
This isn't very erotic.
I think it's an actual utility room.

80
00:05:34,679 --> 00:05:41,044
No, honey. It's a romantic fantasy.
I imagine I'm the janitor, and you're...

81
00:05:41,264 --> 00:05:46,052
...the janitor's wife, who has to
live with me in the utility room.

82
00:05:50,642 --> 00:05:54,257
Don't mind me, folks.
Just need to get the old wet-dry vac.

83
00:05:57,727 --> 00:06:00,927
By now, your new improved love life
should have you flinging woo...

84
00:06:01,103 --> 00:06:02,809
...like nobody's business.

85
00:06:02,979 --> 00:06:07,554
So to you,
Mr. And Mrs. Erotic American, I bid...

86
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:09,804
...good day.

87
00:06:16,191 --> 00:06:19,024
Welcome home, son. I broke two lamps
and lost all your mail.

88
00:06:19,234 --> 00:06:22,102
- What's wrong with your wife?
- You wouldn't understand.

89
00:06:22,276 --> 00:06:23,306
- Flu?
- No.

90
00:06:23,485 --> 00:06:24,859
- Protein deficiency?
- No.

91
00:06:25,027 --> 00:06:28,523
Pneumonoultramicroscopic-
silicovolcanoconiosis?

92
00:06:28,695 --> 00:06:30,769
- No.
- Unsatisfying sex life?

93
00:06:30,946 --> 00:06:34,691
N... Yes! But please,
don't you say that word.

94
00:06:34,905 --> 00:06:37,394
What? Sex?

95
00:06:37,573 --> 00:06:40,358
What's so unappealing
about hearing your elderly father...

96
00:06:40,532 --> 00:06:41,941
...talk about sex?

97
00:06:42,116 --> 00:06:44,901
I had sex.

98
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:53,282
You're home safe. See you
the next time we need your signature.

99
00:06:53,494 --> 00:06:55,734
Oh, you never wanna spend
any time with me.

100
00:06:55,912 --> 00:06:58,661
But I can help you
with your loving problem.

101
00:06:58,829 --> 00:07:03,155
I got a home remedy that'll put
the dowsers back in your trousers.

102
00:07:07,665 --> 00:07:11,529
Legend has it my great grandpappy
stumbled upon this recipe...

103
00:07:11,708 --> 00:07:16,034
...when he was trying to invent
a cheap substitute for holy water.

104
00:07:20,086 --> 00:07:23,168
Here you g... Hey!

105
00:07:24,129 --> 00:07:25,456
Here you go, you ingrate!

106
00:07:25,629 --> 00:07:29,077
Think of me when you're having
the best sex of your life.

107
00:07:30,672 --> 00:07:32,414
Drink it!

108
00:07:42,718 --> 00:07:45,669
Here's $50. Go to the movies,
then take a cab to your aunt's.

109
00:07:45,844 --> 00:07:47,882
Stay there. Call you later.
Now, now, now.

110
00:07:49,053 --> 00:07:52,384
- Homie, what's...?
- Marge, I'll explain to you afterwards.

111
00:08:01,932 --> 00:08:03,887
What do you think Mom and Dad
are doing?

112
00:08:04,058 --> 00:08:05,385
I don't know.

113
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:19,803
Here he is, Rex Harrison
and Paul Anka rolled into one.

114
00:08:21,563 --> 00:08:23,269
That tonic really works.

115
00:08:23,438 --> 00:08:26,389
You and Grampa should bottle it
and go into business together.

116
00:08:26,606 --> 00:08:28,680
You want me to spend
more time with Dad?

117
00:08:28,857 --> 00:08:30,729
What about my New Year's resolution?

118
00:08:30,941 --> 00:08:32,647
You can make a lot of money.

119
00:08:32,858 --> 00:08:35,098
Yeah. Where are my pants?

120
00:08:35,275 --> 00:08:36,851
You threw them out the window.

121
00:08:37,026 --> 00:08:38,981
You said you'd never
need them again.

122
00:08:39,193 --> 00:08:41,480
Oh, hurry, Neddie. They're awful.

123
00:08:41,944 --> 00:08:44,148
You just be ready
with that garbage bag.

124
00:08:47,112 --> 00:08:48,391
Oh, mama!

125
00:08:48,613 --> 00:08:50,236
This is finally really happening.

126
00:08:50,405 --> 00:08:53,522
After years of disappointment
with get-rich-quick schemes...

127
00:08:53,698 --> 00:08:56,021
...I know I'm gonna get rich
with this scheme.

128
00:08:56,199 --> 00:08:57,277
And quick.

129
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,607
Sir? Hello, sir. Yes.

130
00:09:03,784 --> 00:09:07,446
You look like a man who needs help
satisfying his wife. So...

131
00:09:08,869 --> 00:09:12,152
I guess people have some sort
of moral objection to our sex drug.

132
00:09:12,328 --> 00:09:14,034
Let me sell it, you idiot.

133
00:09:15,996 --> 00:09:19,327
Step right up and witness
the magnificent medicinal miracle...

134
00:09:19,497 --> 00:09:23,954
...of Simpson & Son's
patented Revitalizing Tonic!

135
00:09:24,165 --> 00:09:27,365
Put some ardor in your larder
with our energizing, moisturizing...

136
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:34,459
...tantalizing, romanticizing, surprising,
"her-prising," revitalizing tonic!

137
00:09:39,045 --> 00:09:43,952
I doubt very highly that one elixir can
boast so many fantastic properties.

138
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:49,122
What say we amscray out
of here and have a wild wingding...

139
00:09:49,298 --> 00:09:50,707
...at the cyclotron, doctor.

140
00:09:50,882 --> 00:09:54,046
Anything you say, professor.

141
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,871
Tonight, we'll push
the twin beds together.

142
00:09:59,051 --> 00:10:02,880
And I found something for Milhouse
down at the mall too. A pup tent.

143
00:10:03,052 --> 00:10:06,003
Oh, boy!
Now I can sleep out in the yard!

144
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:07,926
Yeah! Every single night.

145
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:13,133
I've discovered that
the rejuvenating effect...

146
00:10:13,305 --> 00:10:15,296
...is actually a mild form of poisoning.

147
00:10:15,473 --> 00:10:17,796
No doubt a result
of the unsanitary conditions...

148
00:10:17,974 --> 00:10:19,597
...in Grampa Simpson's bathtub.

149
00:10:19,766 --> 00:10:21,638
Nonetheless...

150
00:10:30,936 --> 00:10:33,341
What's going on?
Where are all the grownups?

151
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:38,225
Who cares?
With no adults around, I run this city.

152
00:10:40,564 --> 00:10:42,720
Carry on.

153
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:45,097
Listen to this.
"Unexplainable behavior.

154
00:10:45,274 --> 00:10:47,728
Individuals acting
in a secretive fashion...

155
00:10:47,901 --> 00:10:52,608
...are often involved with UFOs
or other paranormal phenomena...

156
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:54,937
...e.g. Telephone explosions."

157
00:10:55,157 --> 00:10:58,441
Jeez! If it's in a book,
it's gotta be true.

158
00:10:58,659 --> 00:11:02,785
Scary, no? And this guy is head
of the Spaceology Department...

159
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:05,236
...at the Correspondence College
of Tampa.

160
00:11:05,414 --> 00:11:07,406
Will you cook my dinner for me?

161
00:11:07,582 --> 00:11:11,530
My parents aren't around and
I'm not allowed to turn on the stove.

162
00:11:13,086 --> 00:11:17,129
Hurry up. We got a lot of tonic to sell
and a lot of towns to visit.

163
00:11:17,339 --> 00:11:20,753
Frigid Falls, Mount Seldom,
Lake Flaccid.

164
00:11:20,925 --> 00:11:24,589
Great. I'm gonna be stuck in a car
all weekend with that wheezy windbag.

165
00:11:26,762 --> 00:11:28,220
And that's what's wrong
with Bart's generation.

166
00:11:28,388 --> 00:11:29,929
Now as for your generation...

167
00:11:32,058 --> 00:11:34,180
And for the minimal outlay
of one dollar...

168
00:11:34,351 --> 00:11:36,841
...you can take home a bottle
of liquid Lothario...

169
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:41,063
...distilled Don Juan,
catalytically carbonated Casanova.

170
00:11:41,273 --> 00:11:45,020
Lock old Rover in the shed,
because man has a new best friend...

171
00:11:45,192 --> 00:11:48,145
...in Simpson & Son's
Revitalizing Tonic.

172
00:11:48,361 --> 00:11:51,563
I'm not convinced.
I've had bad luck with aphrodisiacs.

173
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:55,444
All questions will be answered,
all fears will be allayed...

174
00:11:55,616 --> 00:11:58,022
...with one incontrovertible
demonstration.

175
00:11:58,201 --> 00:12:00,869
May I have a volunteer
from the audience?

176
00:12:01,078 --> 00:12:03,070
Yes, you, sir.

177
00:12:03,497 --> 00:12:05,738
You've never seen me before,
is that correct?

178
00:12:05,915 --> 00:12:07,243
That is correct.

179
00:12:07,416 --> 00:12:10,166
Well, then how come his face
is on the bottle?

180
00:12:19,758 --> 00:12:21,086
You're the worst shill ever!

181
00:12:21,259 --> 00:12:23,547
You're a disgrace
to the medicine show business.

182
00:12:23,719 --> 00:12:26,921
They didn't start chasing us until
you turned on that getaway music.

183
00:12:44,568 --> 00:12:47,188
Okay. It's now painfully clear.

184
00:12:47,361 --> 00:12:51,902
The adults are definitely paving the way
for an invasion by the saucer people.

185
00:12:52,115 --> 00:12:55,483
You fool. Can't you see
it's a massive government conspiracy?

186
00:12:55,701 --> 00:12:58,654
Or have they gotten to you too?

187
00:13:00,371 --> 00:13:02,908
Hey, hey, hey! Stop it! Stop it!

188
00:13:03,081 --> 00:13:05,749
Why are you guys jumping
to such ridiculous conclusions?

189
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:07,831
Haven't you ever heard
of Ockham's razor?

190
00:13:08,001 --> 00:13:10,705
The simplest explanation
is probably the correct one.

191
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,492
- So, what's the simplest explanation?
- I don't know.

192
00:13:13,672 --> 00:13:17,585
Maybe they're all reverse vampires
and they have to get home before dark.

193
00:13:19,009 --> 00:13:24,677
- Reverse vampires!
- Vampires! The undead!

194
00:13:25,096 --> 00:13:29,009
Hey, wait a minute.
That's Amos Pierson's moose farm.

195
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:30,925
Make a right here.

196
00:13:35,812 --> 00:13:37,602
Why are we stopping at this dump?

197
00:13:37,814 --> 00:13:41,146
That's the house you grew up in, son.

198
00:13:43,526 --> 00:13:45,932
Let's go find
that hot dog tree I planted.

199
00:13:46,153 --> 00:13:50,149
Yeah, we lived here
till the bank foreclosed in '63.

200
00:13:50,364 --> 00:13:54,111
Farm went bust after the cows
started giving sour milk.

201
00:13:54,284 --> 00:13:57,782
Something must've
spooked them good.

202
00:13:58,745 --> 00:14:00,487
Stupid cows!

203
00:14:10,796 --> 00:14:15,421
Oh, memories.
If this old place could talk, it'd say...

204
00:14:26,932 --> 00:14:29,932
There she is. The old Radiation King.

205
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:35,218
You'd park yourself right there
and watch for hours on end.

206
00:14:37,982 --> 00:14:40,768
If I may, Helen,
I'd like to respond to that question...

207
00:14:40,942 --> 00:14:43,646
...with yet another flip remark.

208
00:14:48,739 --> 00:14:53,150
Look at me, Mom.
I am President Kennedy.

209
00:14:53,326 --> 00:14:57,025
Oh, Abe, maybe our Homer
could grow up to be president someday.

210
00:14:58,413 --> 00:15:01,781
You, president?
This is the greatest country in the world.

211
00:15:01,957 --> 00:15:04,447
We've got a system set up
to keep people like you...

212
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:06,166
...from ever becoming president.

213
00:15:06,585 --> 00:15:08,493
Quit your daydreaming, melonhead.

214
00:15:09,921 --> 00:15:12,327
Quit your daydreaming, melonhead.

215
00:15:12,506 --> 00:15:15,708
Dad, how come you never gave me
any encouragement?

216
00:15:15,883 --> 00:15:18,587
Maybe I could've been
something more than I am.

217
00:15:18,802 --> 00:15:20,130
Like a travel agent...

218
00:15:20,303 --> 00:15:21,761
...to a great scientist.

219
00:15:21,929 --> 00:15:24,882
Or the inventor
of a hilarious refrigerator alarm.

220
00:15:25,057 --> 00:15:27,677
Who are you to complain?
You lock me up in a home...

221
00:15:27,892 --> 00:15:31,260
...and give me the same damn
shower safety seat every Christmas.

222
00:15:33,813 --> 00:15:35,354
Your whole life,
you never said one nice thing to me.

223
00:15:35,522 --> 00:15:37,679
That's because you're a screwup.

224
00:15:37,899 --> 00:15:40,899
- You're the screwup!
- Why, you little...

225
00:15:41,819 --> 00:15:43,147
All right.

226
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,608
All right, that's it.
We're going home.

227
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:47,772
I'm sick of you and your stupid tonic.

228
00:15:47,948 --> 00:15:50,402
If I hadn't taken that stupid tonic
38 years ago...

229
00:15:50,575 --> 00:15:53,147
...you'd have never been born
and I'd have been happy.

230
00:15:53,368 --> 00:15:55,158
You were an accident!

231
00:15:57,496 --> 00:15:58,824
Get out.

232
00:15:58,997 --> 00:16:01,487
- I'm sorry I said that.
- Out.

233
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:03,871
I'm gonna get out of the car.

234
00:16:04,043 --> 00:16:07,624
And I hope you'll find it in your heart
not to drive awa...

235
00:16:09,713 --> 00:16:15,749
Well, I'll be all right as long
as I can remember my Army training.

236
00:16:16,802 --> 00:16:18,924
Dang.

237
00:16:23,598 --> 00:16:26,004
I'm sorry.

238
00:16:30,562 --> 00:16:32,470
Hi?

239
00:16:33,564 --> 00:16:36,932
Homie, are you really going to
ignore Grampa for the rest of your life?

240
00:16:37,108 --> 00:16:39,942
Of course not, Marge.
Just for the rest of his life.

241
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:42,600
He said I was an accident.
He didn't wanna have me.

242
00:16:42,779 --> 00:16:44,107
You didn't wanna have Bart.

243
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:46,272
You're never supposed
to tell the child.

244
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:48,316
You tell Bart all the time.

245
00:16:48,533 --> 00:16:50,240
But when I do it, it's cute.

246
00:16:50,617 --> 00:16:54,827
So finally, we're all in agreement
about what's going on with the adults.

247
00:16:54,996 --> 00:16:58,529
- Milhouse.
- Okay, here's what we've got.

248
00:16:58,748 --> 00:17:00,289
The Rand Corporation...

249
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:03,956
...in conjunction with the saucer people...
- Thank you.

250
00:17:04,127 --> 00:17:06,284
...under the supervision
of the reverse vampires...

251
00:17:08,964 --> 00:17:11,252
...are forcing our parents
to go to bed early...

252
00:17:11,424 --> 00:17:14,838
...in a fiendish plot
to eliminate the meal of dinner.

253
00:17:15,427 --> 00:17:18,343
We're through
the looking glass here, people.

254
00:17:18,554 --> 00:17:22,301
Kids, your daddy and his daddy
are involved in a very sticky...

255
00:17:22,473 --> 00:17:27,347
...nutty, chewy, chocolatey...
Put it away, boy! ...situation.

256
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:30,353
And your daddy has realized
something very important.

257
00:17:30,563 --> 00:17:33,681
A father should always make
his kids feel wanted.

258
00:17:33,898 --> 00:17:36,435
Starting now, I promise to spend
more time with you...

259
00:17:36,609 --> 00:17:39,478
...and give you the attention
you deserve.

260
00:17:40,236 --> 00:17:42,393
I can't breathe.

261
00:17:43,405 --> 00:17:45,942
And feast your ears
on this tantalizing testimonial...

262
00:17:46,115 --> 00:17:47,941
...from my own flesh and blood.

263
00:17:48,117 --> 00:17:51,152
The son who puts the fun
in Simpson & Son...

264
00:17:51,327 --> 00:17:53,817
...my son, Barney.

265
00:17:54,038 --> 00:17:58,449
I used to be a fat, disgusting slob.

266
00:17:58,666 --> 00:18:01,784
That medicine seems to be
giving your son a lot of gas.

267
00:18:02,002 --> 00:18:07,077
I assure you his belching is the result
of an unrelated alcohol problem.

268
00:18:13,134 --> 00:18:15,671
It just ain't the same without Homer.

269
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:18,219
He knew how to drive a car.

270
00:18:21,891 --> 00:18:24,463
Son. My dear son.

271
00:18:24,643 --> 00:18:27,559
From now on, I'm going to be
a good and attentive father.

272
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:31,138
And for starters, your old man
is gonna teach you how to ride...

273
00:18:31,314 --> 00:18:34,230
...your very first bike.

274
00:18:39,945 --> 00:18:42,565
Dad, number one:
I know how to ride a bike.

275
00:18:42,739 --> 00:18:47,613
Number two: I already own a bike.
And number three: That is a girl's bike.

276
00:18:47,784 --> 00:18:52,907
You're no girl, you're a boy.
A good boy. You can be president.

277
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:55,784
- Scratch that. You will be president!
- Dad!

278
00:18:56,332 --> 00:18:59,830
I think Lisa needs another push
on her new tire swing.

279
00:19:00,543 --> 00:19:03,080
No, Dad. I wanna get down.

280
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:06,709
This tire is filthy
and the steel belts are poking me.

281
00:19:06,923 --> 00:19:09,792
No! No!

282
00:19:10,008 --> 00:19:13,340
No offense, but your half-assed
under-parenting was a lot more fun...

283
00:19:13,511 --> 00:19:15,467
...than your half-assed over-parenting.

284
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:17,505
But I'm using my whole ass.

285
00:19:17,722 --> 00:19:21,255
Dad, it's just that too much
of your love can really be...

286
00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:23,178
...scary.

287
00:19:25,436 --> 00:19:28,270
Someday you'll thank me
for all this scary love.

288
00:19:29,522 --> 00:19:32,438
But now I've gotta go somewhere
and do some serious thinking.

289
00:19:34,818 --> 00:19:39,063
- I'm sure he meant to say "drinking."
- That's what I assumed.

290
00:19:42,448 --> 00:19:45,068
Here's where it all started
to go wrong.

291
00:19:45,283 --> 00:19:49,279
How am I supposed to be a good dad
when I never had one myself?

292
00:19:51,246 --> 00:19:53,736
Oh, Dad wasn't even around
on Christmas morning...

293
00:19:53,914 --> 00:19:56,664
...when I actually got to meet
Santa Claus.

294
00:19:56,833 --> 00:19:58,871
Some father.

295
00:19:59,043 --> 00:20:00,371
Wait a minute...

296
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:02,747
Dad!

297
00:20:04,172 --> 00:20:06,294
This photo is a blessing.

298
00:20:06,465 --> 00:20:08,291
It eases my pain.

299
00:20:17,223 --> 00:20:19,973
This tonic's caused me nothing
but trouble.

300
00:20:20,141 --> 00:20:23,176
You've done all the damage
you're gonna do.

301
00:20:24,144 --> 00:20:26,468
Oh, nuts!

302
00:20:33,109 --> 00:20:35,065
- Dad!
- Son!

303
00:20:35,277 --> 00:20:38,442
I'm a screwup.
I burned down our house.

304
00:20:38,655 --> 00:20:42,236
No. I'm a screwup.
I burned down our house.

305
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:44,405
- You know what?
- What?

306
00:20:44,617 --> 00:20:47,819
- We're both screwups.
- It doesn't matter.

307
00:20:47,995 --> 00:20:50,995
What matters is you were right
when you told me...

308
00:20:51,163 --> 00:20:54,780
...I never said anything nice about you.

309
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,414
So are you gonna say
something nice now?

310
00:20:58,627 --> 00:21:00,334
I hadn't thought that far ahead.

311
00:21:01,754 --> 00:21:04,588
Okay, here it goes.

312
00:21:04,756 --> 00:21:08,503
I'm not sorry I had you, son.

313
00:21:09,009 --> 00:21:12,211
And I was always proud...

314
00:21:12,387 --> 00:21:14,877
...that you weren't a short man.

315
00:21:15,055 --> 00:21:16,513
Oh, Dad.

316
00:21:21,226 --> 00:21:23,383
What do you say
we roll on the grass, son?

317
00:21:23,561 --> 00:21:26,098
I'm with you, Dad.
