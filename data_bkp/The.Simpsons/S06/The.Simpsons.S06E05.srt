1
00:00:04,935 --> 00:00:07,110
Sideshow Bob Roberts

2
00:00:13,986 --> 00:00:16,620
No sports, no rock
No information

3
00:00:16,238 --> 00:00:19,250
For mindless chatter
We're your station

4
00:00:19,241 --> 00:00:22,760
KBBL talk radio. Now Springfield's
favorite conservative...

5
00:00:22,244 --> 00:00:25,198
...author of well-selling book
Only Turkeys Have Left Wings...

6
00:00:25,372 --> 00:00:28,373
...ladies and gentlemen, Birch Barlow.

7
00:00:30,544 --> 00:00:32,916
That Barlow's a right-wing crackpot.

8
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:36,338
He said Ted Kennedy lacked integrity.
Can you believe that?

9
00:00:36,508 --> 00:00:39,712
Yeah, switch the station.
I consider myself politically correct.

10
00:00:39,887 --> 00:00:41,879
His views make me uncomfortable.

11
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,973
No, no, no, guys.
Now, I'm not very political.

12
00:00:45,142 --> 00:00:48,178
I usually think people who vote
are a bit fruity.

13
00:00:48,354 --> 00:00:52,482
But for some reason,
this Birch Barlow really speaks to me.

14
00:00:58,300 --> 00:00:59,489
Good morning, freedom-likers.

15
00:00:59,657 --> 00:01:02,693
Birch Barlow, the fourth branch
of government, the 51st state.

16
00:01:02,868 --> 00:01:06,403
You know, there are three things
we'll never get rid of in Springfield:

17
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:08,489
One, the bats in the public library.

18
00:01:10,125 --> 00:01:12,581
Two, Mrs. McFearley's compost heap.

19
00:01:16,548 --> 00:01:19,502
And three, our six-term mayor...

20
00:01:19,677 --> 00:01:23,342
...the illiterate, tax-cheating,
pot-smoking spend-o-crat...

21
00:01:23,514 --> 00:01:25,720
...Diamond Joe Quimby.

22
00:01:25,891 --> 00:01:27,800
Hey, I am no longer illiterate.

23
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:31,268
Now, why are we doomed to
this Quimby quagmire, you ask...

24
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:33,146
...O reasonable listener?

25
00:01:33,315 --> 00:01:35,474
Because this town
is under the stranglehold...

26
00:01:35,651 --> 00:01:38,189
...of a few tie-dyed "tree-huggers"...

27
00:01:38,362 --> 00:01:40,568
...who'd rather play Hacky Sack
than lock up the homeless.

28
00:01:41,782 --> 00:01:44,451
This sounds awfully controversial.

29
00:01:44,618 --> 00:01:47,821
Lisa, you know I don't like
controversy in this house.

30
00:01:47,997 --> 00:01:49,242
I don't like him either...

31
00:01:49,415 --> 00:01:52,581
...but I'm doing a report on local politics
for my school project.

32
00:01:52,751 --> 00:01:56,369
You think you're so big because
your class always gets to do projects.

33
00:01:56,547 --> 00:02:02,419
Well, I'm doing a school project
on fireworks.

34
00:02:03,262 --> 00:02:05,634
Bart, I wish you wouldn't lie like that.

35
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:10,470
Now, as a special sendoff
and a way to say...

36
00:02:12,146 --> 00:02:14,269
...to our visiting Chinese principals...

37
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:17,394
...Bart Simpson has promised us
a fireworks display.

38
00:02:18,444 --> 00:02:20,567
- Cool.
- Cool.

39
00:02:23,365 --> 00:02:25,821
What a week.
He promise a big firework display.

40
00:02:25,993 --> 00:02:29,326
- Bad student.
- Bad principal.

41
00:02:31,332 --> 00:02:34,167
So, my friends, let's just junk
those dumb-o-crats...

42
00:02:34,335 --> 00:02:36,872
...and their bleeding-heart
smell-fare program.

43
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:40,580
I had to listen to this jerk all morning.
Can we listen to something else?

44
00:02:40,758 --> 00:02:44,174
When I'm driving the car,
I get to choose the radio station.

45
00:02:44,345 --> 00:02:48,556
When you're driving,
we'll listen to your radio station.

46
00:02:53,687 --> 00:02:55,929
I can't take this anymore.
Let's switch back.

47
00:02:56,106 --> 00:02:59,310
Let's go to the phones.
First up is Bob from South Springfield.

48
00:02:59,485 --> 00:03:01,442
- Welcome to you, sir.
- Hello, Birch.

49
00:03:01,612 --> 00:03:03,569
Long-time listener, first-time caller.

50
00:03:03,739 --> 00:03:08,317
Kudos for bringing the "public"
back to the Republican Party.

51
00:03:08,494 --> 00:03:12,194
It's time people realized we conservatives
aren't all Johnny Hatemongers...

52
00:03:12,373 --> 00:03:15,955
...and Charlie Bible-Thumps or even,
God forbid, George Bushes.

53
00:03:16,585 --> 00:03:18,578
That sounds like Sideshow Bob.

54
00:03:18,754 --> 00:03:23,831
Yes, ma'am. Sideshow Bob,
yakking it up on the old yak box.

55
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:28,137
I'll spare you the embarrassment of
admitting you don't know who Bob is.

56
00:03:29,431 --> 00:03:31,922
Sideshow Bob used to be
Krusty the Clown's sidekick.

57
00:03:32,101 --> 00:03:36,763
But in 1990, he framed Krusty for armed
robbery, and Bart got him put in jail.

58
00:03:36,939 --> 00:03:40,106
When he got out, he married Aunt Selma
and tried to murder her.

59
00:03:40,317 --> 00:03:42,855
Oh, Sideshow Bob.

60
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,566
Bart, your mortal enemy is
on the radio.

61
00:03:45,739 --> 00:03:50,734
It's time for more dementia
with Dr. Demento.

62
00:03:52,204 --> 00:03:54,529
And now the Funny 5...

63
00:03:55,165 --> 00:03:59,708
I meant your other mortal enemy.
Sideshow Bob.

64
00:04:00,129 --> 00:04:02,335
Sideshow Bob?

65
00:04:02,881 --> 00:04:05,633
I'm only 10, and I already got
two mortal enemies.

66
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:10,930
And this proposed expressway
will bring increased commerce...

67
00:04:10,264 --> 00:04:11,841
...to our local merchants.

68
00:04:13,559 --> 00:04:14,887
What's in it for us?

69
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:18,263
Give us something we like,
or we'll ride you out of town on a rail.

70
00:04:18,647 --> 00:04:20,936
Well, what do you people like?

71
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:23,226
- Sleep.
- Sexy dames, and plenty of them.

72
00:04:23,402 --> 00:04:26,735
Matlock!

73
00:04:27,865 --> 00:04:33,535
Well, I suppose I could name it
the Matlock Expressway.

74
00:04:36,665 --> 00:04:40,710
But it would be terribly myopic of me
to blame all my current woes...

75
00:04:40,878 --> 00:04:44,543
...on one spiky-haired little simpleton.

76
00:04:44,757 --> 00:04:47,508
Myopic or, to say the least,
intransigent.

77
00:04:47,676 --> 00:04:49,965
Now, you mentioned
some woes there.

78
00:04:50,137 --> 00:04:54,400
Well, you see, Birch,
I'm presently incarcerated.

79
00:04:56,810 --> 00:05:00,600
Convicted of a crime
I didn't even commit.

80
00:05:00,689 --> 00:05:03,524
Attempted murder.
Now, honestly, what is that?

81
00:05:03,692 --> 00:05:07,260
Do they give a Nobel Prize
for attempted chemistry? Do they?

82
00:05:07,863 --> 00:05:10,354
Oh, really.
Now, this is a personal call.

83
00:05:10,532 --> 00:05:13,450
Now, my friends,
isn't this just typical?

84
00:05:13,619 --> 00:05:18,447
Another intelligent conservative here
railroaded by our liberal justice system.

85
00:05:18,624 --> 00:05:23,333
Just like Colonel Oliver North,
Officer Stacey Koon...

86
00:05:23,504 --> 00:05:25,662
...and cartoon smokesperson
Joe Camel.

87
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:28,419
Well, I've had it.

88
00:05:28,592 --> 00:05:33,337
I am gonna make it my mission
to see that our friend Bob is set free.

89
00:05:33,514 --> 00:05:35,257
No!

90
00:05:36,725 --> 00:05:40,590
Well, despite Bart's objections,
the people of South Africa...

91
00:05:40,229 --> 00:05:42,471
...can now vote in free
democratic elections.

92
00:05:42,648 --> 00:05:46,990
My friends, Bob is a political prisoner.

93
00:05:46,276 --> 00:05:49,728
I want every loyal listener
to do everything they can...

94
00:05:49,905 --> 00:05:51,779
...to get him out of jail.

95
00:05:51,949 --> 00:05:53,360
All right, you heard the man.

96
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:55,991
One grenade each.

97
00:05:56,578 --> 00:06:01,573
Moe, I think he meant through
nonviolent, grassroots political action.

98
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:04,241
Oh, Jeez. Really? You think so?

99
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:07,623
All right, give them back. Come on.
Everybody, give them back.

100
00:06:07,798 --> 00:06:10,336
Hey. Hey!
Who pulled the pin on this one?

101
00:06:13,679 --> 00:06:16,348
Very well, if that is the way
the winds are blowing...

102
00:06:16,515 --> 00:06:19,600
...let no one say I don't also blow.

103
00:06:19,184 --> 00:06:20,513
Free Bob!

104
00:06:20,686 --> 00:06:23,936
By special order of
the mayor of Springfield...

105
00:06:24,106 --> 00:06:27,142
...you are hereby granted
a full and complete pardon.

106
00:06:27,318 --> 00:06:31,362
Congratulations,
Robert Underdunk Terwilliger.

107
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:39,661
- Boat's on the other side.
- Yes, thank you.

108
00:07:01,727 --> 00:07:03,102
Hail, brothers.

109
00:07:07,816 --> 00:07:11,481
Now, then, gentlemen,
the mayoral campaign is upon us.

110
00:07:11,654 --> 00:07:13,314
If we hope to defeat Joe Quimby...

111
00:07:13,489 --> 00:07:16,692
...we need a candidate with
name recognition and media savvy.

112
00:07:16,867 --> 00:07:19,987
A true leader
who will do exactly as he's told.

113
00:07:20,162 --> 00:07:21,787
Monty, I'm way ahead of you.

114
00:07:21,955 --> 00:07:26,333
If you'll just open that door,
you'll see the next mayor of Springfield.

115
00:07:29,713 --> 00:07:31,920
Nice. Very nice.

116
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,674
- What did it say?
- No, no. Bob. Bob, come in.

117
00:07:38,305 --> 00:07:40,974
A fine mahoq to you all.

118
00:07:41,141 --> 00:07:42,600
Why, he's even better.

119
00:07:42,768 --> 00:07:45,804
I agree. I like the human touch.

120
00:07:49,149 --> 00:07:52,399
I want you on your best behavior
for this choreographed media event.

121
00:07:52,569 --> 00:07:54,313
There is to be no wising off...

122
00:07:54,488 --> 00:07:57,857
...no face-making and no grass-eating.
This means you, Ralph.

123
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:00,156
- Yes, sir.
- Hello, children.

124
00:08:00,327 --> 00:08:01,406
Hello, Bart.

125
00:08:02,579 --> 00:08:07,400
Friends, my opponent, Joe Quimby,
is confused about your school system.

126
00:08:07,209 --> 00:08:09,878
Do you know what he does?
He flip-flops.

127
00:08:14,133 --> 00:08:18,261
Sometimes he doesn't know
whether he's coming or going.

128
00:08:21,974 --> 00:08:25,580
He wants to sell your future short.

129
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:33,183
Bart, we can't let Bob
steal the spotlight.

130
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,650
We'll have to stoop
to the lowest common denominator.

131
00:08:36,238 --> 00:08:37,317
I can do that.

132
00:08:38,824 --> 00:08:42,193
Help! I'm being attacked by things.

133
00:08:44,204 --> 00:08:46,363
Uncle Mayor was just saying
that us kids...

134
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:49,458
...are the most important
natural resource we have.

135
00:08:49,627 --> 00:08:50,955
More important than coal?

136
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:53,879
Yes.

137
00:08:57,468 --> 00:09:00,634
Oh, that was a big mistake, Bart.

138
00:09:00,888 --> 00:09:03,639
No children have ever meddled
with the Republican Party...

139
00:09:03,807 --> 00:09:05,302
...and lived to tell about it.

140
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:18,398
Stay out of Riverdale.

141
00:09:21,158 --> 00:09:23,447
Without Mayor Quimby
Our town would really stink

142
00:09:23,619 --> 00:09:27,202
We wouldn't have a tire yard
Or a mid-sized roller rink

143
00:09:27,373 --> 00:09:30,907
We wouldn't have our gallows
Or a shiny Bigfoot trap

144
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:34,418
It's not the mayor's fault
That the stadium collapsed

145
00:09:34,588 --> 00:09:37,589
Quimby. If you were running
for mayor, he'd vote for you.

146
00:09:37,758 --> 00:09:39,715
Paid for by
the Mayor Quimby Committee.

147
00:09:39,885 --> 00:09:43,669
Hey, four-eyes, vote Quimby.
Hey, beard-o, vote Quimby.

148
00:09:43,847 --> 00:09:46,303
This time, he's the lesser of two evils.

149
00:09:46,475 --> 00:09:48,764
Yeah, yeah, I love Grimby.

150
00:09:49,395 --> 00:09:52,598
Could I have some more
bumper stickers, please, dude?

151
00:09:57,152 --> 00:09:58,647
All right.

152
00:09:58,862 --> 00:10:02,812
The mummy's ready
for his mystical journey.

153
00:10:04,201 --> 00:10:06,906
What's happening?

154
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:13,331
That Quimby fella promised
to build us a Matlock Expressway.

155
00:10:13,502 --> 00:10:16,622
How you gonna top that, smart guy?

156
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:20,840
Well, how's this?
I'll not only build the expressway...

157
00:10:20,259 --> 00:10:22,631
...I will spend the remainder
of this afternoon...

158
00:10:22,803 --> 00:10:25,590
...patiently listening
to your interminable anecdotes.

159
00:10:25,764 --> 00:10:28,765
Hot diggety damn. Me first!

160
00:10:29,518 --> 00:10:35,230
Not many people know
I owned the first radio in Springfield.

161
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:37,397
Weren't much on the air then.

162
00:10:37,568 --> 00:10:42,645
Just Edison reciting the alphabet
over and over.

163
00:10:42,823 --> 00:10:45,610
"A," he'd say.

164
00:10:45,784 --> 00:10:47,694
Then "B."

165
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:51,155
"C" would usually follow.

166
00:10:52,374 --> 00:10:56,390
Mayor Quimby supports
revolving-door prisons.

167
00:10:56,211 --> 00:10:59,877
Mayor Quimby even released
Sideshow Bob...

168
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:03,299
...a man twice convicted
of attempted murder.

169
00:11:03,469 --> 00:11:06,304
Can you trust a man
like Mayor Quimby?

170
00:11:06,472 --> 00:11:07,800
Vote Sideshow Bob for mayor.

171
00:11:10,976 --> 00:11:15,223
The League of Uninformed Voters
presents the Springfield mayoral debates.

172
00:11:15,397 --> 00:11:18,434
I'm your moderator, Larry King.
Now a word to our audience.

173
00:11:18,609 --> 00:11:21,314
Even though we're being
broadcast on Fox...

174
00:11:21,487 --> 00:11:24,274
...there's no need for obnoxious
hooting and hollering.

175
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:38,248
I shouldn't have shaken hands
with those old people.

176
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,551
I hope that flu doesn't affect
his performance out there.

177
00:11:45,719 --> 00:11:48,210
Don't worry.
He's taken a million of these capsules.

178
00:11:54,853 --> 00:11:57,771
Sideshow Bob,
Councilman Les Wynan...

179
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:01,309
...says that you're not
experienced enough to be mayor.

180
00:12:01,485 --> 00:12:03,359
Sir, what do you have to say
about that?

181
00:12:03,529 --> 00:12:09,282
I'd say that Les Wynan ought to do
more thinking and less whining.

182
00:12:12,121 --> 00:12:15,572
- There's no Councilman Les Wynan.
- Good line, though.

183
00:12:15,749 --> 00:12:20,744
Mayor Quimby, you are well known,
sir, for your lenient stance on crime.

184
00:12:20,921 --> 00:12:24,456
But suppose for a second that
your house was ransacked by thugs...

185
00:12:24,633 --> 00:12:27,883
...your family tied up in the basement
with socks in their mouths.

186
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:31,636
You try to open the door,
but there's too much blood on the knob.

187
00:12:31,807 --> 00:12:34,642
- What is your question?
- My question's about the budget.

188
00:12:48,741 --> 00:12:52,156
I don't agree with
his Bart-killing policy...

189
00:12:52,536 --> 00:12:56,486
...but I do approve of his
Selma-killing policy.

190
00:12:56,665 --> 00:12:58,954
Well, he framed me
for armed robbery...

191
00:12:59,126 --> 00:13:02,791
...but, man, I'm aching
for that upper-class tax cut.

192
00:13:07,926 --> 00:13:11,509
And the results are in.
For Sideshow Bob, 100 percent.

193
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,900
For Joe Quimby, 1 percent.

194
00:13:13,182 --> 00:13:15,851
And we remind you, there is
a 1-percent margin of error.

195
00:13:21,607 --> 00:13:24,980
All right, let's go live
to Bob headquarters now...

196
00:13:24,276 --> 00:13:26,565
...for Mayor Terwilliger's
victory speech.

197
00:13:39,375 --> 00:13:42,375
And just look how happy he is.

198
00:13:55,641 --> 00:13:57,265
It's the rapture!

199
00:13:57,476 --> 00:14:00,181
Quick, get Bart out of the house
before God comes.

200
00:14:03,232 --> 00:14:06,149
So sorry, Mr. Simpson.
Your house is blocking construction...

201
00:14:06,318 --> 00:14:08,260
...of our new Matlock Expressway.

202
00:14:10,406 --> 00:14:12,660
Now, I am a fair man.

203
00:14:12,241 --> 00:14:14,447
You will have 72 hours to vacate.

204
00:14:14,618 --> 00:14:18,319
At that time, we will blow up your house
and any remaining Simpsons.

205
00:14:18,497 --> 00:14:20,655
Homer, we've got to stop them.

206
00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:23,324
I know what you're up to,
Mayor Terwigager...

207
00:14:23,502 --> 00:14:26,669
...and no one in my family's
gonna stand for it.

208
00:14:27,756 --> 00:14:29,998
Move your goddurn house, son.

209
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:38,220
Bart, by special request of the mayor's
office, you are going to be left back.

210
00:14:39,351 --> 00:14:41,640
You mean I have to repeat
the fourth grade?

211
00:14:41,812 --> 00:14:45,644
Well, yes. But not for four or five years.
Bart, you're going to kindergarten.

212
00:14:45,816 --> 00:14:47,690
Kindergarten?

213
00:14:48,861 --> 00:14:52,360
Now, boys and girls,
who knows what this is?

214
00:14:52,573 --> 00:14:54,898
- Triangle.
- Very good, Bart.

215
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:57,745
You have first choice of toys
for free play.

216
00:14:57,911 --> 00:14:59,655
Cool. I call the Flintstone phone.

217
00:15:03,542 --> 00:15:05,535
I like talking to you.

218
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:12,880
We're gonna lose our house and end up
living under a bridge like common trolls.

219
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,293
I don't think Bob
won that election legally.

220
00:15:15,471 --> 00:15:18,175
I can't believe a convicted felon
would get so many votes...

221
00:15:18,349 --> 00:15:20,637
...and another convicted felon
would get so few.

222
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:28,644
Here you go. The results
of last month's mayor election.

223
00:15:28,817 --> 00:15:31,308
All 48,000 voters
and who each one of them voted for.

224
00:15:31,487 --> 00:15:33,812
I thought this was a secret ballot.

225
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:43,702
Okay, Aaron A. Aaronson voted for...

226
00:15:43,874 --> 00:15:45,534
...Bob.

227
00:15:45,709 --> 00:15:48,810
Aaron L. Aaronson voted for...

228
00:15:48,253 --> 00:15:50,246
...Bob.

229
00:15:50,422 --> 00:15:53,542
Arthur B. Ablabab voted for...

230
00:15:53,717 --> 00:15:55,461
...Bob.

231
00:16:10,651 --> 00:16:13,189
Whoever wrote that note
wants to meet us here tonight?

232
00:16:13,362 --> 00:16:17,620
This is so cool, Bart.
We're just like Woodward and Bernstein.

233
00:16:17,241 --> 00:16:20,361
Except their dad wasn't waiting
in the car reading Archie Comics.

234
00:16:20,536 --> 00:16:23,821
Stuck-up Riverdale punks.
Think they're too good for me.

235
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:28,669
You're on the right track.
Follow the names.

236
00:16:28,836 --> 00:16:31,124
How the hell do you know?

237
00:16:33,215 --> 00:16:38,126
I can't tell you who I am,
but I worked on the campaign.

238
00:16:39,847 --> 00:16:42,219
Hey, Mr. Smithers!

239
00:16:42,391 --> 00:16:45,511
Well, you might as well
give me a ride home now.

240
00:16:45,936 --> 00:16:48,605
I've never gone
behind Mr. Burns' back before...

241
00:16:48,772 --> 00:16:51,263
...but Sideshow Bob's
ultra-conservative views...

242
00:16:51,442 --> 00:16:54,775
...conflict with my choice of lifestyle.

243
00:16:56,196 --> 00:16:59,197
All I can do is give you one name.
Edgar Neubauer.

244
00:16:59,366 --> 00:17:01,822
Find him, and you'll find your answer.

245
00:17:07,916 --> 00:17:10,668
No Edgar Neubauer.

246
00:17:18,844 --> 00:17:21,679
This is hopeless. They're gonna
demolish our house for sure.

247
00:17:21,847 --> 00:17:24,172
We're gonna have to move
into a Motel 6.

248
00:17:24,349 --> 00:17:27,304
But Dad can't afford 6 dollars a night.

249
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:31,387
Hey. Lis. Lis, come here. I found him.

250
00:17:31,565 --> 00:17:33,590
I found Edgar Neubauer.

251
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:39,818
Oh, my God. The dead have risen,
and they're voting Republican.

252
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:42,742
No, Bart. Don't you see?
Dead people can't vote.

253
00:17:44,411 --> 00:17:48,195
Look, "Prudence Goodwyfe.
Died, 1641."

254
00:17:48,374 --> 00:17:50,200
She voted for Bob too.

255
00:17:50,542 --> 00:17:53,496
So did Buddy Holly, Richie Valens,
and the Big Bopper.

256
00:17:54,964 --> 00:17:57,289
Even the pet cemetery voted for Bob.

257
00:17:57,466 --> 00:18:01,167
Look. Mr. And Mrs. Bananas,
Humphrey Boa-gart.

258
00:18:01,345 --> 00:18:05,390
Oh, my poor dead kitty,
please, not you too.

259
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:10,433
All right, Bob, now it's personal.

260
00:18:10,604 --> 00:18:13,854
Hey. He did try to kill me.

261
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:45,593
Mr. Mayor, is it true
you rigged the election?

262
00:18:45,764 --> 00:18:47,721
No, I did not.

263
00:18:48,392 --> 00:18:50,349
Kids, help.

264
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:53,391
Oh, I don't mind.

265
00:18:53,564 --> 00:18:56,849
We want these children
to feel justice has been served.

266
00:18:57,260 --> 00:19:03,146
That way, they can sleep soundly tonight
on their hard, feculent motel pillows.

267
00:19:03,615 --> 00:19:07,827
Well, Bart, Lisa, here I am.

268
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:11,489
I have a plan. I think we can trap him.

269
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:19,670
You know, Sideshow Bob, I believe you
when you say you're innocent.

270
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,667
- Indeed, I am.
- Because we all know...

271
00:19:21,842 --> 00:19:24,415
...you're a naive pawn,
puppet, if you will...

272
00:19:24,595 --> 00:19:29,138
...of the most diabolical political genius
Springfield has ever known:

273
00:19:29,308 --> 00:19:31,384
Birchibald T. Barlow!

274
00:19:34,688 --> 00:19:36,645
Wait...

275
00:19:36,815 --> 00:19:40,350
You don't have the intelligence to rig
an election by yourself, do you?

276
00:19:40,527 --> 00:19:43,612
- You were just Barlow's lackey.
- You were Ronnie to his Nancy.

277
00:19:43,781 --> 00:19:46,651
- Sonny to his Cher.
- Ringo to his rest of the Beatles.

278
00:19:46,825 --> 00:19:51,950
Enough! Lies, lies! I did it! I did it all!

279
00:19:53,999 --> 00:19:58,578
There. Is that what you want,
you smarmy little bastards?

280
00:19:58,754 --> 00:20:01,210
- We want the truth.
- You want the truth?

281
00:20:01,382 --> 00:20:05,545
You can't handle the truth.
No truth-handler, you.

282
00:20:06,303 --> 00:20:10,870
I deride your truth-handling abilities.

283
00:20:10,265 --> 00:20:12,258
- Will you get to the point?
- Yes.

284
00:20:12,434 --> 00:20:17,262
Only I could have executed such
a masterpiece of electoral fraud.

285
00:20:17,439 --> 00:20:19,183
And I have the records to prove it.

286
00:20:19,358 --> 00:20:25,640
Here, just look at these.
Each one a work of Machiavellian art.

287
00:20:27,783 --> 00:20:31,911
- But why?
- Because you need me, Springfield.

288
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:35,662
Your guilty conscience may force you
to vote Democratic.

289
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:39,416
But deep down inside, you secretly long
for a cold-hearted Republican...

290
00:20:39,586 --> 00:20:43,380
...to lower taxes, brutalize criminals
and rule you like a king.

291
00:20:43,215 --> 00:20:46,916
That's why I did this.
To protect you from yourselves.

292
00:20:47,428 --> 00:20:48,970
Now, if you don't mind,
I have a city to run.

293
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:55,469
- Bailiffs, place the mayor under arrest.
- What? Oh, yes, all that stuff I did.

294
00:20:57,229 --> 00:20:59,767
Bart, we did it.
Now we get to keep our house...

295
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:02,478
...and you get to go
back to the fourth grade.

296
00:21:02,651 --> 00:21:05,486
Tomorrow we were gonna find out
who the dish ran away with.

297
00:21:05,654 --> 00:21:08,691
- The spoon, Bart.
- Of course.

298
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:16,325
Someday, I'll have my vengeance.

299
00:21:16,498 --> 00:21:21,493
Someday, when I find my way out of
this savage, roach-ridden cesspool.

300
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:26,208
- Say, Terwilliger's a Yalie.
- Bob, come along.

301
00:21:26,383 --> 00:21:29,633
We need an eighth to row
against the Princeton alums.

302
00:21:29,803 --> 00:21:31,463
Princeton?

303
00:21:34,558 --> 00:21:37,960
Stroke. Stroke.
