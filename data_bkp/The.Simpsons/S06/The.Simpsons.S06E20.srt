00:00:05,978 --> 00:00:07,805
Two Dozen and One Greyhounds

2
00:00:34,965 --> 00:00:38,299
Welcome to the 6:00 news,
in our brand-new studio.

3
00:00:38,469 --> 00:00:40,545
Looking good, Springfield.

4
00:00:43,349 --> 00:00:46,883
In today's news, a 2-ton rhino
escaped from the Springfield Zoo.

5
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:48,887
But zoo officials were quick to act...

6
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:53,310
...and Petunia, as she is known,
is safely back in captivity.

7
00:00:54,526 --> 00:00:56,151
In other news, a 3-ton rhino...

8
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,720
...that escaped from the zoo last week
is still at large.

9
00:01:01,325 --> 00:01:03,680
All right, who broke my vase?

10
00:01:03,243 --> 00:01:05,913
Who took my tests off the refrigerator
and tore them up?

11
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,330
Who spread garbage all over
Flanders' yard before I got a chance to?

12
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,991
Oh, please.
This is senseless destruction...

13
00:01:12,169 --> 00:01:14,292
...with none of my usual
social commentary.

14
00:01:16,507 --> 00:01:18,998
If it wasn't you, then who was it?

15
00:01:20,427 --> 00:01:23,677
I'm sure these things didn't destroy
themselves, now, did they?

16
00:01:23,847 --> 00:01:25,507
Did they?

17
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:33,580
I guess Bart's not to blame.
He's lucky too...

18
00:01:33,232 --> 00:01:37,312
...because it's spanking season, and
I got a hankering for some spankering.

19
00:01:39,571 --> 00:01:41,694
I don't know why you're
so energetic today...

20
00:01:41,865 --> 00:01:44,154
...but prepare to be worn out.

21
00:01:48,872 --> 00:01:52,491
What's wrong, boy? Getting tired?

22
00:02:05,973 --> 00:02:09,140
I think there's really something wrong
with Santa's Little Helper.

23
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:12,643
He was up barking all night and dug up
the back yard worse than ever.

24
00:02:13,814 --> 00:02:16,850
- My bongo drums!
- My strobe light!

25
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:19,861
My Best of Ray Stevens,
featuring "The Streak," album.

26
00:02:20,154 --> 00:02:22,858
So it was the dog
that buried all our stuff.

27
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,941
Yes, the dog.

28
00:02:26,827 --> 00:02:30,659
Oh, my God! He's got
the precious cable-TV cable!

29
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:37,203
Always use fresh macaroni.

30
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,874
If the box rattles, throw it away.

31
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:46,180
Your cable TV
is experiencing difficulties.

32
00:02:46,347 --> 00:02:47,841
Please do not panic.

33
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:51,135
Resist the temptation to read
or talk to loved ones.

34
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:53,101
Do not attempt sexual relations...

35
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:58,146
...as years of TV radiation have left
your genitals withered and useless.

36
00:02:58,317 --> 00:02:59,645
Well, I'll be damned.

37
00:03:05,115 --> 00:03:08,330
Excuse me. We're having
a problem with our dog.

38
00:03:08,202 --> 00:03:10,444
I'll tell you what I'm telling
everyone else.

39
00:03:10,621 --> 00:03:14,701
I'm sorry if your dog went blind, but your
gripe is with Hartz Mountain, not me.

40
00:03:14,875 --> 00:03:17,544
No. No, our dog is out of control.

41
00:03:17,711 --> 00:03:22,500
He's wild, destructive and has little
or no respect for authority.

42
00:03:22,675 --> 00:03:25,379
Let me try a canine-human mind meld.

43
00:03:25,552 --> 00:03:29,218
It's an incredibly rare psychic power
possessed only by me...

44
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:31,596
...and three other clerks at this store.

45
00:03:31,767 --> 00:03:33,594
Okay.

46
00:03:38,315 --> 00:03:41,400
I'm bored. I'm restless.

47
00:03:41,568 --> 00:03:43,442
Need change in life...

48
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:47,614
...like imported leather leash...

49
00:03:47,783 --> 00:03:50,250
...blue contact lenses...

50
00:03:50,202 --> 00:03:52,693
...200-volt-shock training collar.

51
00:03:53,414 --> 00:03:56,580
Well, problem solved.

52
00:03:57,710 --> 00:04:00,960
- Homer, hold on to the wheel!
- You got it.

53
00:04:03,257 --> 00:04:04,917
Hey!

54
00:04:06,552 --> 00:04:10,300
Don't worry. We'll catch him
or run him over trying.

55
00:04:10,222 --> 00:04:13,342
He's headed to the greyhound
racing track where we found him.

56
00:04:13,517 --> 00:04:16,186
Don't worry, when they find out
he doesn't have money...

57
00:04:16,353 --> 00:04:19,140
...they'll throw him out.
Believe me, I know.

58
00:04:25,738 --> 00:04:27,564
This place is so big.

59
00:04:27,906 --> 00:04:30,742
Do you think we should split up
and look for him, Homie?

60
00:04:30,909 --> 00:04:33,946
- Homie?
- Two bucks to win on number eight.

61
00:04:34,121 --> 00:04:38,664
And have you seen my beloved dog?
Give me the ticket.

62
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:43,834
We can't lose.
Look at the name of the dog I bet on.

63
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,797
"She's the Fastest."

64
00:04:45,966 --> 00:04:47,959
I don't think that means, necessarily...

65
00:04:48,135 --> 00:04:51,504
And they're off. She's the Fastest
jumps out to an insurmountable lead.

66
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,803
You're lucky you got looks, Marge.

67
00:04:53,974 --> 00:04:56,500
Around the far turn,
it's She's the Fastest.

68
00:04:56,226 --> 00:04:58,931
Followed by Always Comes in Second
and I'm Number Three.

69
00:04:59,104 --> 00:05:00,812
Yes! Come on, you little horse!

70
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,485
And they're in the home stretch. It's...
Wait! Another dog is on the track.

71
00:05:05,653 --> 00:05:07,645
- Santa's Little Helper!
- The mystery dog...

72
00:05:07,821 --> 00:05:11,273
...gaining fast on the outside.
Of course, he could never win this race.

73
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:13,324
Or could he?

74
00:05:20,793 --> 00:05:24,162
What's Santa's Little Helper
doing to that dog?

75
00:05:24,338 --> 00:05:27,707
Looks like he's trying to jump over her,
but he can't quite make it.

76
00:05:27,883 --> 00:05:29,508
Come on, boy! You can do it!

77
00:05:29,677 --> 00:05:31,550
Ladies and gentlemen, this is the end.

78
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,962
This is the end of dog racing.

79
00:05:35,808 --> 00:05:38,346
I think they're in love.

80
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:47,855
So that's what's been wrong
with the little fella.

81
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,698
He misses casual sex.

82
00:05:50,864 --> 00:05:53,710
- Can we keep Santa's girlfriend, Mom?
- Please?

83
00:05:53,242 --> 00:05:56,408
- But she's not our dog.
- She's yours now.

84
00:05:56,578 --> 00:05:59,496
Once they fall in love,
they lose their racing spirit.

85
00:05:59,665 --> 00:06:02,950
Won't you miss her loyalty
and companionship?

86
00:06:06,547 --> 00:06:09,417
Lady, you're all right.

87
00:06:12,594 --> 00:06:14,552
Okay, you can go out and play.

88
00:06:14,722 --> 00:06:17,925
But no more you-know-what
in front of the house, all right?

89
00:06:18,475 --> 00:06:20,848
Hey! What did I just say?

90
00:06:54,178 --> 00:06:55,886
Take it. It fell on the floor.

91
00:07:12,363 --> 00:07:14,230
Hey, boy, you wanna play fetch?

92
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,942
Me and Santa's Little Helper
used to be a team.

93
00:07:19,119 --> 00:07:22,370
But he never wants to play anymore
since his bitch moved in.

94
00:07:22,206 --> 00:07:26,380
- Don't ever say that word again.
- Well, that's what she is. I looked it up.

95
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:29,661
Well, I'm going to write the dictionary
people and have that checked.

96
00:07:29,838 --> 00:07:31,831
Feels like a mistake to me.

97
00:07:32,424 --> 00:07:36,837
Hey, look. A really small dog
just fell out of Santa's girlfriend.

98
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,420
Oh, my God! She's having babies!

99
00:07:39,598 --> 00:07:42,848
Oh, I'm sorry, girl.
I thought you were just getting fat.

100
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:46,304
- Look, it's twins!
- No, it's two sets of twins.

101
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,556
- Two sets of twins and a triplet.
- Homer.

102
00:07:48,732 --> 00:07:51,982
Homer, find a place
for all these little miracles.

103
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:09,451
Oh, my. I've never seen
anything like this.

104
00:08:09,628 --> 00:08:11,122
How many more can there be?

105
00:08:11,297 --> 00:08:13,254
Twenty-two.

106
00:08:13,424 --> 00:08:15,547
Twenty-three.

107
00:08:15,718 --> 00:08:17,426
Twenty-four.

108
00:08:23,642 --> 00:08:26,596
Twenty-five.

109
00:08:38,323 --> 00:08:40,612
Twenty-five puppies.

110
00:08:44,538 --> 00:08:46,696
An army of dogs!

111
00:08:46,874 --> 00:08:49,958
No bully will ever touch me again.

112
00:08:51,795 --> 00:08:53,289
Hey, jerkface.

113
00:08:53,464 --> 00:08:56,251
You have the face of a jerk.

114
00:08:56,675 --> 00:08:59,380
- All right, Simpson, you asked for...
- Get him, boys.

115
00:09:05,934 --> 00:09:07,892
Say, Jimbo...

116
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:11,727
...hope I wasn't out of line
with that "jerkface" crack.

117
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:34,248
Oh, Homie, aren't they adorable?

118
00:09:34,421 --> 00:09:36,995
Yes. We waited many years...

119
00:09:37,174 --> 00:09:41,800
...but the good Lord has finally
blessed us with a real family.

120
00:09:53,357 --> 00:09:56,560
Look at Branford II. Isn't that cute?

121
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:58,728
He thinks he's one of the Models Inc.

122
00:10:02,449 --> 00:10:04,691
Get that cat out of the way!

123
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:12,542
My socks.

124
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:23,383
Mom, why do I have to wear
a flea collar?

125
00:10:23,554 --> 00:10:25,178
Oh, it's just easier this way.

126
00:10:40,946 --> 00:10:42,903
This time...

127
00:10:47,161 --> 00:10:48,869
This house stinks.

128
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:51,789
Are you just putting new newspapers
over the old ones?

129
00:10:51,957 --> 00:10:54,579
Do you have a better idea?

130
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,329
Now, I know we love the puppies
very much...

131
00:10:58,505 --> 00:11:00,831
...but I think they're getting
to be a problem.

132
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,341
Yeah, they ate all my socks.
I have to wear Lisa's to school today.

133
00:11:04,511 --> 00:11:07,927
- How do you explain the culottes, boy?
- I have to coordinate, don't I?

134
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:10,470
We've been thinking about
giving the puppies away.

135
00:11:10,642 --> 00:11:12,968
- No!
- Mainly your mother.

136
00:11:13,145 --> 00:11:14,853
Is that what we do in this family?

137
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:18,391
When someone becomes an
inconvenience, we just get rid of them?

138
00:11:22,488 --> 00:11:26,485
Hello? Is anybody there?

139
00:11:30,162 --> 00:11:32,867
All right, we'll give the dogs
one more chance.

140
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:37,369
As long as the puppies don't do
anything else wrong, they stay.

141
00:11:37,586 --> 00:11:39,378
On a completely unrelated topic...

142
00:11:39,546 --> 00:11:42,382
...I'm having a very, very important
dinner party tonight.

143
00:11:42,549 --> 00:11:44,589
Splendid. Who's coming?

144
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:47,333
Reverend Lovejoy,
your old Army drill sergeant...

145
00:11:47,513 --> 00:11:50,300
...and the regional director of the IRS.

146
00:11:52,685 --> 00:11:54,761
Oh, just lovely, Marge.

147
00:11:54,937 --> 00:11:57,642
The whole town will hear
what a perfect evening this was.

148
00:11:57,815 --> 00:12:00,140
- How nothing at all went wrong.
- Simpson.

149
00:12:00,317 --> 00:12:03,104
This evening has gone so flawlessly,
I'm gonna forget...

150
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:05,816
...that you were mistakenly
let out of the Army early.

151
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:08,278
I'm so impressed
by this problem-free evening...

152
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:12,744
...that there's no need for that audit.
- A toast to the Simpsons.

153
00:12:12,913 --> 00:12:14,573
And to the delectable turkey...

154
00:12:14,748 --> 00:12:17,453
...that's walking around the table!

155
00:12:17,626 --> 00:12:19,666
Dear Lord, it's a demon bird.

156
00:12:27,177 --> 00:12:31,175
Simpson! See you at reveille,
0500 tomorrow.

157
00:12:31,348 --> 00:12:33,341
See you at the IRS.

158
00:12:33,517 --> 00:12:35,308
See you in hell.

159
00:12:35,477 --> 00:12:36,509
From heaven.

160
00:12:42,568 --> 00:12:46,352
Well, we sure could use a pooch
to guard the flock at the Flanderosa.

161
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:50,113
It'd be nice to have some companionship
when Mother goes out on dates.

162
00:12:50,284 --> 00:12:52,573
We could use a new pet
over at the home...

163
00:12:52,745 --> 00:12:56,908
...seeing how we accidentally
killed that smart-mouthed bird.

164
00:13:01,712 --> 00:13:03,539
They don't like being broken up.

165
00:13:03,714 --> 00:13:05,753
We've got to be realistic, kids.

166
00:13:05,924 --> 00:13:09,708
Who's gonna have a big enough heart
to take care of 25 puppies?

167
00:13:10,638 --> 00:13:14,849
And I know the little fellas would love
romping around my many acres...

168
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:16,511
...chasing my many cars...

169
00:13:16,685 --> 00:13:19,354
...drinking from my many toilets.
- Who wouldn't?

170
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:23,728
Mom, don't give the puppies to him.
He'll be mean to them.

171
00:13:23,901 --> 00:13:27,981
She's right, Homer. There's
something about his face I don't trust.

172
00:13:32,868 --> 00:13:34,825
I'm sorry, Mr. Burns...

173
00:13:34,995 --> 00:13:39,574
...but you can't have these dogs.
Am I fired?

174
00:13:40,292 --> 00:13:41,834
Oh, of course not.

175
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,244
They're your pets.
You can do as you wish.

176
00:13:44,421 --> 00:13:45,915
Good day, everyone.

177
00:13:47,841 --> 00:13:52,384
- My, he certainly took that well.
- A little too well, if you ask me.

178
00:13:52,554 --> 00:13:56,504
I'm sure he's plotting some
brilliant scheme to get those puppies.

179
00:13:57,685 --> 00:14:01,552
There you go. There you go. You too.

180
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:06,108
Honestly, sir, you don't put the effort
into your schemes that you used to.

181
00:14:17,913 --> 00:14:20,119
Don't worry, folks,
we'll find your wallet.

182
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:24,419
Dogs. Chief, you're getting
powdered sugar all over my floor.

183
00:14:24,586 --> 00:14:26,912
No, I'm not. No, I'm not.

184
00:14:27,798 --> 00:14:30,870
I'm dusting for prints.

185
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:31,795
We don't have to wait for cops.

186
00:14:31,969 --> 00:14:34,376
Who can track them better
than their mom and dad?

187
00:14:34,555 --> 00:14:36,346
Let's go find your babies.

188
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:41,270
Dinner's on, dogs.

189
00:14:43,147 --> 00:14:47,310
I'm sorry, kids. I don't think we're
ever gonna find your greyhounds.

190
00:14:47,484 --> 00:14:51,778
Maybe Mr. Burns will sell you
one of the 25 he got last night.

191
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:09,870
Who knows what horrible things he's
doing to those innocent little puppies.

192
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:24,809
There. Now, wasn't that heavenly?
And don't you feel better too?

193
00:15:25,689 --> 00:15:27,433
He's giving them a bath.

194
00:15:27,775 --> 00:15:29,269
There you are.

195
00:15:29,443 --> 00:15:32,527
There you go, little fella. And you.

196
00:15:36,575 --> 00:15:38,781
Smithers, look. He's standing up.

197
00:15:39,995 --> 00:15:43,495
I've never seen anything so adorable.
You know who it reminds me of?

198
00:15:43,666 --> 00:15:45,410
- Benji?
- No.

199
00:15:45,209 --> 00:15:46,703
- Lassie?
- No, no.

200
00:15:46,877 --> 00:15:49,582
- A person. You know who I mean.
- Snoop Doggy Dogg?

201
00:15:49,755 --> 00:15:52,626
- Bob Barker? David Brenner?
- No, no.

202
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,884
The person who's always
standing and walking.

203
00:15:56,530 --> 00:15:58,805
- Rory Calhoun?
- That's it!

204
00:15:59,348 --> 00:16:03,180
You stay with me.
You're the pick of the litter.

205
00:16:06,605 --> 00:16:09,891
Maybe we were wrong about Burns
on this one.

206
00:16:12,152 --> 00:16:14,525
Are you sure you wanna
go through with this, sir?

207
00:16:14,697 --> 00:16:17,152
You do have a very full wardrobe
as it is.

208
00:16:17,324 --> 00:16:22,235
Yes. But not completely full.
For, you see:

209
00:16:22,413 --> 00:16:25,283
Some men hunt for sport

210
00:16:25,457 --> 00:16:27,746
Others hunt for food

211
00:16:27,918 --> 00:16:32,545
The only thing I'm hunting for

212
00:16:33,257 --> 00:16:39,129
Is an outfit that looks good

213
00:16:42,474 --> 00:16:46,638
See my vest
See my vest

214
00:16:46,812 --> 00:16:48,686
Made from real gorilla chest

215
00:16:48,856 --> 00:16:52,770
Feel this sweater, there's no better
Than authentic Irish setter

216
00:16:52,943 --> 00:16:54,568
See this hat
'Twas my cat

217
00:16:54,778 --> 00:16:56,937
My evening wear, vampire bat

218
00:16:57,114 --> 00:17:00,815
These white slippers
Are albino African endangered rhino

219
00:17:00,993 --> 00:17:04,860
Grizzly-bear underwear
Turtles ' necks, I've got my share

220
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:08,739
Beret of poodle
On my noodle it shall rest

221
00:17:08,917 --> 00:17:12,915
Try my red-robin suit
It comes one breast or two

222
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:14,832
See my vest
See my vest

223
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,830
See my vest

224
00:17:20,179 --> 00:17:25,256
Like my loafers?
Former gophers

225
00:17:25,434 --> 00:17:27,676
It was that or skin my chauffeurs

226
00:17:27,853 --> 00:17:31,187
But a greyhound-fur tuxedo
Would be best

227
00:17:31,357 --> 00:17:34,808
- So let's prepare these dogs
- Kill two for matching clogs

228
00:17:34,985 --> 00:17:38,700
See my vest
See my vest

229
00:17:38,238 --> 00:17:45,119
Oh, please, won 't you see my vest?

230
00:17:45,454 --> 00:17:48,289
- I really like the vest.
- I gathered, yeah.

231
00:17:48,874 --> 00:17:52,325
He's gonna make a tuxedo
out of our puppies.

232
00:17:53,837 --> 00:17:56,708
- Bart.
- Sorry. You gotta admit, it's catchy.

233
00:17:56,882 --> 00:18:00,381
Come on, Smithers. Let's go
finish the little flea circuses off.

234
00:18:00,552 --> 00:18:04,870
Except for little Monty, of course.

235
00:18:05,224 --> 00:18:08,110
We gotta get the dogs out of there.

236
00:18:12,106 --> 00:18:14,857
- Hush, puppies.
- We gotta get you out of here.

237
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,906
I know. The window.

238
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:27,280
- No. What are you doing?
- Dogs always land on their feet.

239
00:18:27,454 --> 00:18:30,280
- That's cats.
- No, it's dogs. I'll prove it.

240
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:34,370
Best two out of three.

241
00:18:37,131 --> 00:18:40,100
Bart, look. A laundry chute.

242
00:18:40,175 --> 00:18:42,417
Okay, guys. Let's move.

243
00:18:49,393 --> 00:18:51,849
Come on, come on.

244
00:18:52,146 --> 00:18:54,352
I've got an idea.

245
00:19:03,866 --> 00:19:08,160
Sorry, Monty,
but you're too big for this ride.

246
00:19:14,543 --> 00:19:16,666
- Quick, let's get the...
- Going somewhere?

247
00:19:16,837 --> 00:19:19,838
That's impossible.
How did you get here first?

248
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,628
Oh, there'll be plenty of time
for explanations later.

249
00:19:22,801 --> 00:19:24,344
Right now, I'll be taking
my puppies back.

250
00:19:26,513 --> 00:19:28,138
But they're ours.
You stole them from us.

251
00:19:28,307 --> 00:19:31,474
Here's a phone.
Call somebody who cares.

252
00:19:32,227 --> 00:19:34,932
Give me that.
Now, if you'll excuse us, children...

253
00:19:35,356 --> 00:19:37,977
...the pups have a date
with a fashion knife.

254
00:19:39,568 --> 00:19:43,151
There. Now you don't know
which one's little Monty.

255
00:19:43,322 --> 00:19:47,865
If you don't want him to be part of your
tuxedo, you'll let the other dogs go too.

256
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:51,902
Nice try.
Come on, little Monty. Stand up.

257
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:55,407
Come on, stand up. Do your trick.

258
00:19:55,584 --> 00:19:57,292
No. Don't. Stay down, Monty.

259
00:19:57,461 --> 00:20:01,210
- Stay down. Stay down, boy.
- No. Don't get up. Good boy.

260
00:20:01,632 --> 00:20:02,960
Excellent.

261
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:14,386
Now it's simply a matter
of bending down...

262
00:20:14,561 --> 00:20:17,266
...and picking up the one and only...

263
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:22,355
This can't be happening.
They're all standing.

264
00:20:22,528 --> 00:20:24,983
I can't tell them apart.

265
00:20:25,948 --> 00:20:28,106
All right, you win.

266
00:20:28,283 --> 00:20:30,739
- I'll have to kill them all.
- No!

267
00:20:32,997 --> 00:20:35,452
But they're so wretchedly adorable.

268
00:20:35,624 --> 00:20:38,910
Twenty-five little Rory Calhouns.

269
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:40,580
I can't do it.

270
00:20:40,754 --> 00:20:42,498
But I can kill you.

271
00:20:44,258 --> 00:20:47,128
No, I can't kill you either.

272
00:20:47,302 --> 00:20:51,300
Look at you, standing there
on your hind legs...

273
00:20:51,473 --> 00:20:54,110
...like a couple of Rory Calhouns.

274
00:20:56,145 --> 00:21:00,474
Mr. Burns, I hope you've realized the folly
of killing innocent animals for fashion.

275
00:21:00,649 --> 00:21:05,774
I have, I have. I swear, I'll never wear
any clothing made from an animal...

276
00:21:05,946 --> 00:21:08,152
...that can do an amusing trick.

277
00:21:08,699 --> 00:21:11,735
Another victory for Montgomery Burns '
champion greyhounds.

278
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:14,690
Twenty-five dogs,
25 world champions...

279
00:21:14,246 --> 00:21:17,810
...which so far have earned
their owner over $ 10 million.

280
00:21:17,249 --> 00:21:20,452
I'll bet whoever gave him those dogs
is kicking themselves now.

281
00:21:23,505 --> 00:21:25,961
Homer! For the love of God, no!

282
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:31,510
Marge, you know that batting
this light bulb is the only thing...

283
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:35,844
...that cheers me up after giving away
those million-dollar greyhounds.
