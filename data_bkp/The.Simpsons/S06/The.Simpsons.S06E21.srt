1
00:00:05,936 --> 00:00:07,596
The PTA Disbands

2
00:00:41,305 --> 00:00:44,341
This bus has seen better days.

3
00:00:44,516 --> 00:00:46,758
Well, at least it's safer
than the old bus.

4
00:00:52,983 --> 00:00:55,557
Time to move.
The hole's getting bigger.

5
00:01:00,824 --> 00:01:03,315
Seymour, the children are playing
in the hole again.

6
00:01:03,494 --> 00:01:04,869
Shouldn't you get that fixed?

7
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:07,451
Edna, you know they just
cut the school's budget.

8
00:01:07,623 --> 00:01:09,829
If I had the money,
I'd fix the exhaust leak.

9
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:12,367
I think it's causing
some of our low test scores.

10
00:01:19,176 --> 00:01:21,548
The battlefield is just
a half-mile ahead.

11
00:01:21,762 --> 00:01:24,218
Begin braking procedure!

12
00:01:30,229 --> 00:01:35,223
This Civil War cannon has been fully
restored and is in ready-to-fire condition.

13
00:01:35,401 --> 00:01:37,773
But it's a good thing
we're not firing it...

14
00:01:37,987 --> 00:01:42,732
...because it happens to be aimed at the
main support leg of that lookout tower.

15
00:01:43,158 --> 00:01:46,990
People don't realize that these cannons
are very sensitive...

16
00:01:47,162 --> 00:01:50,781
...and the slightest jolt could
set them off.

17
00:01:52,876 --> 00:01:54,536
Of course, for safety reasons...

18
00:01:54,753 --> 00:01:56,912
...we don't keep the cannon loaded.

19
00:01:57,890 --> 00:01:59,820
It's just common sense.

20
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:06,500
Otto, why don't you get some more gas.
Here's the credit card.

21
00:02:07,516 --> 00:02:08,796
And a mint for afterwards.

22
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:12,517
Five dollars a child?
Last year it was free!

23
00:02:12,688 --> 00:02:14,990
New ownership.

24
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:22,687
But we don't have that kind of money.
In fact, no school could afford...

25
00:02:30,706 --> 00:02:33,576
Here's the admission,
plus something for you.

26
00:02:33,751 --> 00:02:35,992
See that they get
a little extra education.

27
00:02:36,211 --> 00:02:38,121
Yes, sir, Principal Valiant!

28
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:41,583
He thinks he's so hot ever since
he swept the Princi Awards.

29
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:43,134
Those things are rigged.

30
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:49,681
On May 21, 1864, the men
of the 9th Bearded Infantry...

31
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:52,388
...were sunning and fluffing
their beards in the sun.

32
00:02:52,603 --> 00:02:56,980
Suddenly, enemy troops
crested that hill over there.

33
00:02:57,149 --> 00:03:00,435
Fort Springfield,
we surrender unconditionally!

34
00:03:00,611 --> 00:03:02,687
We're sick!
We need leeches...

35
00:03:02,863 --> 00:03:05,734
...and hacksaws to saw off
our gangrenous limbs.

36
00:03:05,908 --> 00:03:09,775
But the Springfield brigade was
too brave to accept their surrender.

37
00:03:09,953 --> 00:03:13,821
Come on, boys. Those white flags
are no match for our muskets!

38
00:03:13,999 --> 00:03:15,624
Charge!

39
00:03:15,793 --> 00:03:18,747
And the Springfielders heroically
slaughtered their enemies...

40
00:03:18,921 --> 00:03:20,913
...as they prayed for mercy.

41
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:28,510
It's hard to see what's going on.
I can only make out the fat soldiers.

42
00:03:28,681 --> 00:03:30,900
All right, children. Switch.

43
00:03:32,935 --> 00:03:35,852
Hey, they're trying to learn for free!

44
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:38,808
- Get them!
- Use your phony guns as clubs!

45
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,981
Run, children.

46
00:03:42,152 --> 00:03:44,987
Start the bus, Otto! Start the bus!

47
00:03:45,698 --> 00:03:48,901
Damn! I shouldn't have
eaten the mint first.

48
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:52,700
Okay, hop on.

49
00:03:52,871 --> 00:03:54,994
Wait! Wait!

50
00:04:04,675 --> 00:04:06,798
Seymour, because of
your penny-pinching...

51
00:04:06,969 --> 00:04:10,219
...we're coming back from a field trip
with the fewest children yet.

52
00:04:10,389 --> 00:04:13,639
God bless the man who invented
permission slips.

53
00:04:15,811 --> 00:04:17,638
I think I got your lunch.

54
00:04:20,357 --> 00:04:21,851
I didn't think this was for me.

55
00:04:24,987 --> 00:04:26,814
Seymour, the teachers are fed up.

56
00:04:26,989 --> 00:04:29,650
You have to put money
back into the school.

57
00:04:29,241 --> 00:04:30,819
You've cut back on everything.

58
00:04:30,993 --> 00:04:33,828
Salaries, supplies, the food.

59
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:36,821
I don't care what you say,
I can taste the newspaper.

60
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:40,908
Shredded newspapers add much-needed
roughage and essential inks.

61
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:43,494
Besides, you didn't notice
the old gym mats.

62
00:04:43,714 --> 00:04:46,466
There's very little meat
in these gym mats.

63
00:04:46,675 --> 00:04:48,798
Our demands are very reasonable.

64
00:04:48,969 --> 00:04:52,136
By ignoring them, you're selling out
these children's futures.

65
00:04:52,348 --> 00:04:55,799
Oh, come on, Edna! We both know
these children have no future!

66
00:04:59,355 --> 00:05:03,103
Prove me wrong, kids.
Prove me wrong.

67
00:05:05,653 --> 00:05:07,444
I've never seen them
fight like that.

68
00:05:07,613 --> 00:05:10,982
I'm worried that all this posturing
could lead to a teachers' strike.

69
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,358
Strike, eh?

70
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:16,697
My bones are so brittle.

71
00:05:16,872 --> 00:05:19,826
But I always drink plenty of "malk"?

72
00:05:21,669 --> 00:05:24,456
How do you expect us to teach
with these supplies?

73
00:05:24,672 --> 00:05:26,913
This pointer's so old,
it's worn down to a nub.

74
00:05:28,217 --> 00:05:29,628
It still points, doesn't it?

75
00:05:29,802 --> 00:05:31,841
Stop that! And look at this.

76
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:35,179
The only books we have are ones
that were banned by other schools.

77
00:05:36,767 --> 00:05:40,266
Well, the kids have to learn about
Tek War sooner or later.

78
00:05:41,522 --> 00:05:43,514
Go away, Bart.
This is not a good time.

79
00:05:43,732 --> 00:05:45,226
I saw you two fighting.

80
00:05:45,401 --> 00:05:48,900
I'm worried there could be a strike
and the school would shut down.

81
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:50,779
I'm sure you'd really hate that.

82
00:05:51,115 --> 00:05:54,281
- There's not going to be a strike, Bart.
- Yeah.

83
00:05:54,451 --> 00:05:57,156
Skinner said you wouldn't
go through with it.

84
00:05:57,329 --> 00:06:00,247
- Skinner said that?
- Well, I had to clean it up a little.

85
00:06:00,624 --> 00:06:04,289
But basically, Krabappel said you'd give
the teachers everything they want.

86
00:06:04,461 --> 00:06:05,742
- She did?
- Yeah.

87
00:06:05,921 --> 00:06:08,590
She said you'd fold faster
than Superman on laundry day.

88
00:06:08,966 --> 00:06:10,543
We'll see about that.

89
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:14,591
Simpson, I always thought you were
sneaky and manipulative.

90
00:06:14,763 --> 00:06:18,298
Now I see you're
really a very sensitive little boy.

91
00:06:18,517 --> 00:06:20,225
Thank you, sir.

92
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,723
You're being totally unfair,
and the teachers won't stand for it!

93
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:27,977
Teachers! You don't have
the guts to strike!

94
00:06:28,152 --> 00:06:31,568
You don't have the guts
to take us all on!

95
00:06:35,784 --> 00:06:38,454
- That's it!
- Strike!

96
00:06:41,707 --> 00:06:44,198
Attention, this is
an emergency broadcast.

97
00:06:44,376 --> 00:06:49,204
All is well in the school.
My authority as principal is total...

98
00:06:49,381 --> 00:06:50,959
Hey, give me that!

99
00:06:51,133 --> 00:06:54,882
Attention, teachers. We're on strike!

100
00:06:57,181 --> 00:06:58,805
Oh, no. Strike?

101
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,222
Miss Hoover, are you on...?

102
00:07:01,393 --> 00:07:03,469
Go home, children.

103
00:07:03,937 --> 00:07:06,960
Hello?

104
00:07:06,607 --> 00:07:10,580
Mrs. Pommelhorst?

105
00:07:10,986 --> 00:07:12,860
I'd like to get down now.

106
00:07:18,327 --> 00:07:22,621
Hey, now that Largo's gone,
we can play the forbidden music.

107
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:30,440
I heard that!

108
00:07:39,932 --> 00:07:42,553
Bart? Lisa? What are you two
doing home so early?

109
00:07:42,726 --> 00:07:45,893
- Great news, Mom!
- Horrible news, Mom!

110
00:07:46,105 --> 00:07:48,856
The school's on strike! Maybe forever.

111
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,480
Overload. Pleasure overload.

112
00:07:53,487 --> 00:07:56,108
Luckily I've prepared for this,
so I'm not too worried.

113
00:08:00,953 --> 00:08:03,823
Sit up straight. Eyes forward.
No talking.

114
00:08:03,998 --> 00:08:07,820
Is that gum? Is that gum?
Is that gum?

115
00:08:07,251 --> 00:08:09,540
Oh, yeah.

116
00:08:11,171 --> 00:08:14,836
Bart, leave that crowbar here. You know
I don't like you prying and jimmying.

117
00:08:15,217 --> 00:08:17,673
Mom! Dad! Great news!
The teachers are on...

118
00:08:17,845 --> 00:08:20,418
- We heard.
- And we already hired a tutor.

119
00:08:20,597 --> 00:08:23,135
Well, looks like we'll be
staying late today...

120
00:08:23,309 --> 00:08:25,800
...to make up for all this dilly-dallying.

121
00:08:37,698 --> 00:08:39,192
Awesome.

122
00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:43,661
You, at the crane!
Spin around real fast!

123
00:08:48,876 --> 00:08:52,624
Now, you! Dump 3 tons of sand
onto that Porta-Potty.

124
00:08:56,884 --> 00:09:00,716
Hey! Can't you tell my voice
from a 10-year-old kid's?

125
00:09:01,555 --> 00:09:02,930
Ay caramba!

126
00:09:18,781 --> 00:09:21,532
Hey, that little boy
is playing three games at once.

127
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:22,696
- Checkmate.
- Checkmate.

128
00:09:22,868 --> 00:09:23,864
- Checkmate.
- Dang.

129
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,997
Lousy teachers, trying
to palm off our kids on us.

130
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:31,835
Dad, by striking, they're trying
to change management...

131
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,209
...so they can be happier
and more productive.

132
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:37,713
Lisa, if you don't like your job,
you don't strike.

133
00:09:37,883 --> 00:09:42,130
You just go in every day
and do it really half-assed.

134
00:09:42,304 --> 00:09:43,964
That's the American way.

135
00:09:44,181 --> 00:09:46,886
I've got textbooks.
But without state-approved syllabi...

136
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:50,600
...and standardized testing,
my education can only go so far.

137
00:09:50,229 --> 00:09:52,684
Honey, maybe you should
relax a little.

138
00:09:52,898 --> 00:09:56,848
Relax? I can't relax!
Nor can I yield, relent or...

139
00:09:57,861 --> 00:09:59,901
Only two synonyms?

140
00:10:00,656 --> 00:10:04,404
Oh, my God!
I'm losing my perspicacity!

141
00:10:05,995 --> 00:10:08,664
Well, it's always in
the last place you look.

142
00:10:14,169 --> 00:10:17,503
If we were in school this week,
what do you think we'd be learning?

143
00:10:17,673 --> 00:10:19,840
Get away from me.

144
00:10:19,299 --> 00:10:21,173
Good news, people!

145
00:10:21,844 --> 00:10:25,378
I'm happy to announce another union
has joined us in a sympathy strike!

146
00:10:25,556 --> 00:10:27,881
The Piano Tuners Local 412!

147
00:10:33,272 --> 00:10:35,977
Now for Operation
Strike-Make-Go-Longer.

148
00:10:37,192 --> 00:10:41,240
You know, I heard Skinner say
the teachers will crack any minute.

149
00:10:45,534 --> 00:10:48,203
Skinner said we'll crack,
purple monkey dishwasher.

150
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:49,781
Well, we'll show him!

151
00:10:49,955 --> 00:10:53,538
Especially for that "purple
monkey dishwasher" remark.

152
00:10:55,878 --> 00:10:58,203
Seymour, you are truly incompetent!

153
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:01,465
- Well, I hardly think it's fair...
- Dummy up, you!

154
00:11:01,633 --> 00:11:04,588
Listen to those passing motorists
who support the teachers.

155
00:11:09,767 --> 00:11:11,309
Fifteen-minute recess, Milhouse.

156
00:11:11,477 --> 00:11:14,500
The recess assignment is
chapters three through seven.

157
00:11:14,271 --> 00:11:16,844
Yay! Recess!

158
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:21,186
I found a hive of killer bees.
You want to go throw rocks at it?

159
00:11:21,403 --> 00:11:24,938
Sorry, Bart. I'm deeply immersed
in the Teapot Dome scandal.

160
00:11:25,741 --> 00:11:28,410
However, it might
be feasible in a fortnight.

161
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:30,615
I can play in two weeks.

162
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:38,625
I just can't believe Stark
would stoop to that...

163
00:11:38,796 --> 00:11:43,125
...and right in the middle
of Montana and Dakota's wedding.

164
00:11:45,719 --> 00:11:50,346
All this free time. I never thought I'd get
sick of Razor Fight II, The Slashening.

165
00:11:50,516 --> 00:11:54,300
I probably should stop. My doctor says
I have the wrists of an 80-year-old.

166
00:11:59,149 --> 00:12:02,649
What do you mean, the bank
is out of money? Insolvent?

167
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:05,441
You only have enough cash
for the next three customers?

168
00:12:10,786 --> 00:12:15,329
Just a second here.
No, no. I don't have your money here.

169
00:12:15,499 --> 00:12:18,868
It's in Bill's house, and Fred's house.

170
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:22,170
Hey, what the hell you doing with
my money in your house, Fred?

171
00:12:28,846 --> 00:12:31,171
Grade me! Look at me!

172
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:33,133
Evaluate and rank me!

173
00:12:33,308 --> 00:12:35,716
I'm good, good, good
and, oh, so smart!

174
00:12:35,894 --> 00:12:37,721
Grade me!

175
00:12:45,988 --> 00:12:47,815
I'm worried about the kids, Homie.

176
00:12:48,157 --> 00:12:50,564
Lisa's becoming very obsessive.

177
00:12:50,743 --> 00:12:53,909
This morning, I caught her trying
to dissect her own raincoat.

178
00:12:54,913 --> 00:12:59,706
I know. And this perpetual-motion
machine she made today is a joke.

179
00:12:59,877 --> 00:13:02,581
It just keeps going faster and faster.

180
00:13:02,796 --> 00:13:04,706
And Bart isn't doing very well either.

181
00:13:04,882 --> 00:13:07,170
He needs boundaries and structure.

182
00:13:07,593 --> 00:13:11,673
There's something about flying a kite
at night that's so unwholesome.

183
00:13:11,847 --> 00:13:14,890
Hello, Mother dear.

184
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:17,686
That's it! We have to get them
back to school.

185
00:13:17,853 --> 00:13:21,139
I'm with you, Marge.
Lisa, get in here.

186
00:13:22,358 --> 00:13:25,561
In this house, we obey
the laws of thermodynamics!

187
00:13:28,197 --> 00:13:32,146
All right. I'd like to call this meeting
of the PTA to or-diddly-order.

188
00:13:32,368 --> 00:13:34,859
Let's see if we can't put
an end to this strike fuss.

189
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:38,121
- Mrs. Krabappel, why don't you begin.
- Boo.

190
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:41,739
Oh, "boo" yourself!
Our demands are simple.

191
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:46,581
A small cost-of-living increase and better
equipment and supplies for your children.

192
00:13:47,132 --> 00:13:48,959
- Yeah, all right!
- Give it to them!

193
00:13:49,677 --> 00:13:52,214
Yeah, in a dream world.
We have a very tight budget.

194
00:13:52,388 --> 00:13:55,175
To do what she's asking,
we'd have to raise taxes.

195
00:13:55,391 --> 00:13:57,763
- Raise taxes?
- They're too high as they are now.

196
00:13:57,935 --> 00:13:59,726
- I've had enough.
- Taxes are bad.

197
00:13:59,937 --> 00:14:01,348
It's your children's future.

198
00:14:01,563 --> 00:14:04,517
- Children's future.
- Yes, children are important.

199
00:14:04,733 --> 00:14:06,856
- It'll cost you.
- Oh, the taxes.

200
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:09,399
They're gonna raise taxes.

201
00:14:09,613 --> 00:14:12,282
- Come on.
- All right, that's a good point.

202
00:14:12,449 --> 00:14:14,193
Oh, yeah, that sounds...

203
00:14:14,702 --> 00:14:17,406
- Oh, yeah, the taxes.
- That means money.

204
00:14:17,579 --> 00:14:19,655
The finger thing means the taxes.

205
00:14:19,873 --> 00:14:23,657
I guess this is a case where
we'll have to agree to disagree.

206
00:14:23,836 --> 00:14:25,793
- I don't agree to that.
- Neither do I.

207
00:14:27,339 --> 00:14:28,917
This is a dilly of a pickle.

208
00:14:29,174 --> 00:14:32,128
Oh, my God! The PTA has disbanded!

209
00:14:34,304 --> 00:14:37,471
No, no! The PTA has not disbanded.

210
00:14:40,602 --> 00:14:44,814
We do have an emergency plan,
in case of a prolonged strike, right here.

211
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,518
Let's see.

212
00:14:46,859 --> 00:14:50,691
"Replace teachers
with superintelligent cyborgs.

213
00:14:50,863 --> 00:14:54,232
Or, if cyborgs aren't invented yet,
use people from the neighborhood."

214
00:14:57,202 --> 00:15:00,453
Talking out of turn, that's a paddling.

215
00:15:00,622 --> 00:15:04,490
Looking out the window,
that's a paddling.

216
00:15:04,668 --> 00:15:08,333
Staring at my sandals,
that's a paddling.

217
00:15:08,797 --> 00:15:13,910
Paddling the school canoe,
you better believe that's a paddling.

218
00:15:17,556 --> 00:15:20,225
All right, so the compression
and expansion...

219
00:15:20,392 --> 00:15:23,844
...of the longitudinal waves
cause the erratic oscillation...

220
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:27,348
You can see it there.
- Of the neighboring particles.

221
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:29,768
Yes? What is it? What? What is it?

222
00:15:29,985 --> 00:15:32,310
- Can I play with it?
- No, you can't play with it.

223
00:15:32,488 --> 00:15:35,607
You won't enjoy it
on as many levels as I do.

224
00:15:36,575 --> 00:15:38,651
The colors, children.

225
00:15:39,286 --> 00:15:43,615
Okay, when I call your name,
you say "present" or "here."

226
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:45,368
No, say "present."

227
00:15:45,918 --> 00:15:47,957
Anita Bath.

228
00:15:49,296 --> 00:15:52,131
All right. Settle down.
Anita Bath here?

229
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:55,175
All right, fine. Fine.

230
00:15:55,344 --> 00:15:56,838
Maya Buttreeks.

231
00:16:01,183 --> 00:16:03,721
Hey, what are you laughing at? What?

232
00:16:03,894 --> 00:16:07,140
Oh, I get it. I get it.

233
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:11,230
It's my big ears, isn't it, kids? Isn't it?

234
00:16:11,443 --> 00:16:14,278
Well, children, I can't help that.

235
00:16:20,202 --> 00:16:24,366
Wow, Bart! I'm impressed the way
you knocked off all those substitutes.

236
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:27,327
In my weaker moments,
I almost pity them.

237
00:16:27,501 --> 00:16:31,415
Then I just remind myself,
they're trying to teach.

238
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:36,422
I don't know what you did to all those
substitutes, but it's going to stop now.

239
00:16:36,593 --> 00:16:37,969
Leopold?

240
00:16:38,137 --> 00:16:42,929
All right. You listen up, you little freaks!
The fun stops here.

241
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:46,635
You're gonna shut your
stinking traps and behave, damn it!

242
00:16:46,812 --> 00:16:49,385
This is one substitute
you're not gonna screw with!

243
00:16:50,441 --> 00:16:52,517
Marge Simpson.

244
00:16:54,111 --> 00:16:56,436
Hello, class. Hi, Bart.

245
00:16:56,613 --> 00:16:58,939
Over here, sweetie.
It's me, Mom.

246
00:16:59,241 --> 00:17:02,361
Hi. Hey. Hello!

247
00:17:08,751 --> 00:17:12,840
Well, I'm sure some of you already
know me. I'm Bart Simpson's mother.

248
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:17,716
Mom.

249
00:17:17,927 --> 00:17:20,880
Hey, Bart, what about the booby trap?

250
00:17:25,267 --> 00:17:26,761
- May I?
- Thank you.

251
00:17:26,977 --> 00:17:29,812
- Mama's boy!
- Teacher's pet! Teacher's pet!

252
00:17:31,106 --> 00:17:33,348
I meant the other booby trap.

253
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:39,983
Kids have been doing
that one since my day.

254
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,993
So how was everybody's
day at school?

255
00:17:45,204 --> 00:17:46,579
- Horrifying.
- Pointless.

256
00:17:46,789 --> 00:17:50,703
Exhausting. It took the children 40
minutes to locate Canada on the map.

257
00:17:50,876 --> 00:17:54,494
Marge, anyone can miss Canada,
all tucked away down there.

258
00:17:54,672 --> 00:17:58,455
My teacher's a nightmare. Three kids got
sick from inhaling his ointment fumes.

259
00:17:58,634 --> 00:18:02,133
He confiscated everything made of tin.
And then he sent us home early...

260
00:18:02,304 --> 00:18:05,175
...because he got his beard
caught in the pencil sharpener.

261
00:18:08,185 --> 00:18:10,261
Oh, okay.

262
00:18:11,355 --> 00:18:12,814
Here.

263
00:18:14,441 --> 00:18:16,897
Okay. Let's see.

264
00:18:17,152 --> 00:18:19,359
What if I did this?

265
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,900
You're on your own.

266
00:18:24,994 --> 00:18:27,663
There's no way I'll get into
an Ivy League school now.

267
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:30,534
At this rate, I probably won't
even get into Vassar.

268
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:34,408
I've had just about enough
of your Vassar-bashing, young lady!

269
00:18:34,586 --> 00:18:37,671
Look, Mom. It feels really weird
having you on my turf.

270
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,832
How would you feel
if I started mopping?

271
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,464
I'd be thrilled.
You can start right now.

272
00:18:42,886 --> 00:18:46,600
And I'm gonna keep teaching your class,
like it or lump it.

273
00:18:46,181 --> 00:18:51,389
Well, then. I guess I'll just have
to get into the crawlspace again.

274
00:18:52,187 --> 00:18:54,310
I hate it when he gets in there.

275
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:04,698
Over here.

276
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:07,619
Mom, I need a dollar.

277
00:19:07,786 --> 00:19:10,906
Since you started teaching,
kids have been taking my lunch money.

278
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:12,789
And I need that money for candy.

279
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:17,462
Here you go, precious.
Now, go off with your friends.

280
00:19:17,922 --> 00:19:20,591
"Here you go, precious."

281
00:19:23,427 --> 00:19:25,384
Why isn't my mom stopping this?

282
00:19:25,554 --> 00:19:27,962
We've created a diversion.

283
00:19:29,141 --> 00:19:31,134
That's a very nice jig, Kearney.

284
00:19:31,352 --> 00:19:33,640
Now, isn't dancing much more
fun than bullying?

285
00:19:33,854 --> 00:19:35,313
Yeah.

286
00:19:37,358 --> 00:19:40,193
That's it.
I can't take this anymore, Milhouse.

287
00:19:40,402 --> 00:19:42,312
I've got to get the real teachers back.

288
00:19:42,488 --> 00:19:45,821
Bart, you'll never get Krabappel
and Skinner together again.

289
00:19:45,991 --> 00:19:49,158
They're like two
positively charged ions.

290
00:19:50,913 --> 00:19:52,193
Wait, that's it.

291
00:19:52,373 --> 00:19:56,453
With your book smarts and my ability
to exploit people with book smarts...

292
00:19:56,627 --> 00:19:59,414
...we can figure out a plan
to get them back together.

293
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:03,810
A surprise party for me
in Principal Skinner's office?

294
00:20:03,258 --> 00:20:05,631
Well, I don't know, but all right.

295
00:20:05,803 --> 00:20:08,258
Me? Go to my office?

296
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:10,387
It's highly irregular, but all right.

297
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:14,514
You're not coming out
until you reach an agreement.

298
00:20:14,687 --> 00:20:16,763
- Let us out, Bart!
- This is not funny, Bart.

299
00:20:16,939 --> 00:20:19,430
- I mean it.
- Stop it, Bart! Let us out right now!

300
00:20:20,693 --> 00:20:23,693
- Don't worry. They'll start negotiating.
- Bart, open this door!

301
00:20:23,862 --> 00:20:27,907
- Let us out!
- For the love of God, let us out!

302
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:34,156
Come on!
You are gonna be so sorry.

303
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:43,497
- Let us out right now!
- You're gonna be very, very sorry!

304
00:20:43,882 --> 00:20:45,590
Help! Well...

305
00:20:45,759 --> 00:20:48,297
...Seymour, I guess we could
start talking.

306
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:50,463
What's the point?
There's no more money...

307
00:20:50,681 --> 00:20:53,254
...unless you've got some magic
new source of revenue.

308
00:20:53,559 --> 00:20:56,595
We've got to figure it out.
We're locked in here like prisoners.

309
00:20:56,770 --> 00:20:59,590
Prisoners in our own school.

310
00:21:06,864 --> 00:21:08,903
This was a great way
to make extra money...

311
00:21:09,116 --> 00:21:12,200
...renting out our cloakrooms
to the overcrowded prison system.

312
00:21:12,411 --> 00:21:14,984
Yo. I used to sit right over there.

313
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:20,996
It's all right, children.
Just ignore the murderer.

314
00:21:21,211 --> 00:21:24,470
And as a bonus, some of our more
troublesome students...

315
00:21:24,214 --> 00:21:26,207
...might be scared straight.

316
00:21:27,593 --> 00:21:30,166
Kid, help me break out of here.

317
00:21:30,346 --> 00:21:32,469
I'll totally make it worth your while.

318
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,597
I'm listening.
