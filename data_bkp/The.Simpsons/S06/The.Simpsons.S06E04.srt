1
00:00:06,395 --> 00:00:07,854
Itchy and Scratchy Land

2
00:01:13,879 --> 00:01:17,462
Thanks, kids. Now I'd like to speak
to you seriously for a moment.

3
00:01:17,633 --> 00:01:20,883
Yep. This week is the grand opening
of Itchy & Scratchy Land.

4
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:23,626
The violentest place on Earth.

5
00:01:23,806 --> 00:01:28,800
And to celebrate, for this week only,
we're cutting ticket prices in half.

6
00:01:33,816 --> 00:01:35,689
Kids, you heard the cartoon rat.

7
00:01:35,859 --> 00:01:39,110
If you haven't already run to your
parents begging to go, do it now.

8
00:01:39,279 --> 00:01:42,150
You won't miss anything funny.
I'll just be sitting here...

9
00:01:42,324 --> 00:01:45,325
...reading this grownups’ newspaper.

10
00:01:46,912 --> 00:01:48,241
Go now.

11
00:01:48,455 --> 00:01:51,575
Dad, remember how you said that
going to Itchy & Scratchy Land...

12
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:53,410
...would be too damned expensive?

13
00:01:53,585 --> 00:01:55,958
Oh, everything's too damn
expensive these days.

14
00:01:56,130 --> 00:02:01,504
Look at this Bible I just got, 15 bucks.
And talk about a preachy book.

15
00:02:01,677 --> 00:02:04,713
Everybody's a sinner,
except for this guy.

16
00:02:04,888 --> 00:02:08,174
But now Itchy & Scratchy Land
is cutting ticket prices in half.

17
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:10,888
Can we go, Dad? Can we,
can we, can we? Take it, Lis.

18
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:13,979
- Can we?
- No, no, no. Ask your mother.

19
00:02:16,608 --> 00:02:20,274
- Mom, guess what.
- We're going to Itchy & Scratchy Land.

20
00:02:20,446 --> 00:02:23,316
No. I've already planned our vacation.

21
00:02:23,532 --> 00:02:26,568
We're going to the Highway 9
bird sanctuary.

22
00:02:26,744 --> 00:02:30,409
I understand they've installed
a new bird feeder this year.

23
00:02:31,623 --> 00:02:36,416
It's shaped like a diner.
And it's on this really tall pole.

24
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,629
Mom, Dad, Bart's dead!

25
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:48,719
That's right. Dead serious about
going to Itchy & Scratchy Land.

26
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:52,601
You know, Itchy & Scratchy Land
isn't just for kids.

27
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:55,806
They have a place called
Parents' Island.

28
00:02:55,981 --> 00:03:00,442
Yeah. Dancing, bowling, fashionable
shops, over 100 bars and saloons...

29
00:03:00,611 --> 00:03:03,695
...and a world-class
chemical-dependency center.

30
00:03:03,864 --> 00:03:06,735
TV Town. Hammock Land!

31
00:03:06,909 --> 00:03:09,400
"Recipe-related bumper cars."

32
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:16,739
Wait a minute. I'm not sure about this.

33
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:20,584
Every time we've ever gone on vacation,
I end up being horribly embarrassed.

34
00:03:20,756 --> 00:03:24,890
We have a big fight and we come home
more miserable than when we left.

35
00:03:24,259 --> 00:03:27,213
You have to promise me that this
isn't gonna happen this time.

36
00:03:27,388 --> 00:03:32,140
- Embarrassed? What do you mean?
- Well, our trip to the Amish country.

37
00:03:32,184 --> 00:03:34,141
Oh, yes.

38
00:03:35,312 --> 00:03:38,266
Hey, look, Marge.
They're still not fighting back.

39
00:03:39,441 --> 00:03:42,810
I can be a jerk
and no one can stop me.

40
00:03:43,612 --> 00:03:46,200
Even worse was our trip
to Sandy Beach.

41
00:03:52,538 --> 00:03:54,198
Suckers.

42
00:03:55,916 --> 00:03:58,122
Sharkboy!

43
00:03:59,545 --> 00:04:02,166
This year I want us to do things
together as a family.

44
00:04:02,339 --> 00:04:04,379
And get a lot of
good exercise outdoors...

45
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:07,883
...so we'll have a lot of
wonderful memories of our vacation.

46
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:10,461
Don't worry, Mom.
We'll make you proud of us.

47
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:14,851
Lobster hat, fishnet Speedo Jr.,
wheelie shoes...

48
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:17,110
...invisible-dog leash.

49
00:04:18,314 --> 00:04:19,512
Well, I'm packed.

50
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:22,150
Remember, every morning,
give a bowl of kibble...

51
00:04:22,192 --> 00:04:25,312
...to Santa's Little Helper.
Do you want me to write this down?

52
00:04:25,487 --> 00:04:28,275
No. I ain't senile, dad blast it.

53
00:04:28,449 --> 00:04:31,700
- Okay, bye-bye.
- Bye, Grampa.

54
00:04:31,243 --> 00:04:33,912
Wait a minute. What was
that last thing you said?

55
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:38,159
Grampa's Little Helper? What's that?

56
00:04:38,459 --> 00:04:41,495
Which one of you is the mailman?

57
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:46,665
Okay, let's make a pact. This is
gonna be the best vacation ever...

58
00:04:46,842 --> 00:04:50,450
...or we'll all agree to disband
and join other families.

59
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:51,252
Agreed.

60
00:04:52,806 --> 00:04:55,428
The interstate.
Fasten your seatbelts, kids.

61
00:04:55,601 --> 00:04:58,721
We're on our way to
Itchy & Scratchy Land.

62
00:05:00,814 --> 00:05:04,598
Don't worry. I've got an ace
up my sleeve.

63
00:05:20,793 --> 00:05:22,702
- Dad, can we stop at Flickey's?
- No.

64
00:05:29,593 --> 00:05:31,752
Oh, my God. What'll I do?
What'll I do?

65
00:05:31,929 --> 00:05:35,973
What's the matter with you? We don't
have any fruits or vegetables in the car.

66
00:05:36,725 --> 00:05:39,133
The whole trunk's full of them, Marge.

67
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:44,185
Got any fruits or vegetables?

68
00:05:46,902 --> 00:05:50,353
Hey. Mr. Wimbley, it happened again.

69
00:05:50,531 --> 00:05:54,778
Now to absorb some local color
through the magic of AM radio.

70
00:05:55,411 --> 00:06:00,370
The book of Revelation tells us
to watch for the seven signs of evil.

71
00:06:01,125 --> 00:06:03,201
Sign of evil number four...

72
00:06:03,377 --> 00:06:07,457
Continuing our sign-of-evil countdown,
here's Vanessa Williams.

73
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:14,342
Haven't we stood in five
different states long enough?

74
00:06:14,513 --> 00:06:16,910
No.

75
00:06:25,482 --> 00:06:27,771
We better find a motel
and stop for the night.

76
00:06:27,943 --> 00:06:32,522
We don't need to do that, Marge.
I'm not tired. I'm not tired at all.

77
00:06:37,745 --> 00:06:39,239
Glad that wasn't us.

78
00:06:41,206 --> 00:06:44,540
North, south. Nuts to this.

79
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:48,375
- I'm gonna take a shortcut.
- Homer, no. You're gonna get lost.

80
00:06:48,547 --> 00:06:52,592
Trust me, Marge. With today's
modern cars, you can't get lost.

81
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:55,298
What with all the silicon chips
and such.

82
00:07:05,397 --> 00:07:09,980
All right, we're here. Let us
never speak of the shortcut again.

83
00:07:09,276 --> 00:07:12,396
Now remember, we're in the Itchy Lot.

84
00:07:16,951 --> 00:07:20,402
We're now approaching our final
destination, Itchy & Scratchy Land.

85
00:07:20,579 --> 00:07:24,244
The amusement park of the future
where nothing can possib-lie go wrong.

86
00:07:25,501 --> 00:07:27,244
Possibly go wrong.

87
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,790
That's the first thing
that's ever gone wrong.

88
00:07:47,731 --> 00:07:49,688
One adult and four children.

89
00:07:49,858 --> 00:07:52,650
Do you want to buy some
Itchy & Scratchy money?

90
00:07:52,236 --> 00:07:54,561
- What's that?
- Money that's made for the park.

91
00:07:54,738 --> 00:07:57,739
It works just like regular money,
but it's fun.

92
00:07:57,908 --> 00:08:00,779
- Do it, Dad.
- Well, okay. If it's fun.

93
00:08:00,953 --> 00:08:04,120
Let's see. I'll take $ 1100 worth.

94
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,297
- Cool, that is neato.
- Oh, wow. Cool.

95
00:08:17,469 --> 00:08:19,842
Such a violent motif.

96
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:23,846
Yeah, but it's just pretend violence,
which is actually beneficial for children.

97
00:08:27,896 --> 00:08:31,348
There's no need to murmur, ma'am.
Here at Itchy & Scratchy Land...

98
00:08:31,525 --> 00:08:34,443
...we're just as concerned
about violence as you are.

99
00:08:34,611 --> 00:08:37,482
That's why we're always careful
to show the consequences...

100
00:08:37,656 --> 00:08:40,741
...of deadly mayhem so that we may
educate as well as horrify.

101
00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:42,617
When do you show the consequences?

102
00:08:42,786 --> 00:08:44,993
On TV, that mouse pulled out
the cat's lungs...

103
00:08:45,164 --> 00:08:46,824
...and played them like a bagpipe.

104
00:08:46,999 --> 00:08:49,288
In the next scene,
the cat's breathing comfortably.

105
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:50,658
Just like in real life.

106
00:08:51,462 --> 00:08:52,920
Hey, look over there.

107
00:08:56,967 --> 00:08:59,423
- A brain burger with extra pus, please.
- Bart.

108
00:08:59,595 --> 00:09:01,718
- Eyeball stew.
- Homer. We just got here...

109
00:09:01,889 --> 00:09:05,388
...and already I'm mortified beyond
belief by your embarrassing behavior.

110
00:09:05,559 --> 00:09:09,427
I was just ordering a cheeseburger. They
have violent names for everything here.

111
00:09:09,605 --> 00:09:13,188
Oh, I see. All right.

112
00:09:14,234 --> 00:09:18,660
- I'll have the baby guts.
- Lady, you disgust me.

113
00:09:19,114 --> 00:09:20,906
Mom, that's veal.

114
00:09:23,994 --> 00:09:28,656
- You sure she'll have fun here?
- Of course. Babies love the ball room.

115
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:42,425
Torture Land, Explosion Land...

116
00:09:42,596 --> 00:09:48,848
...Searing Gas Pain Land,
Unnecessary Surgery Land.

117
00:09:49,687 --> 00:09:52,438
Oh, look. It's the 12 noon robot parade.

118
00:09:52,606 --> 00:09:55,180
Hurry up or we'll have
to wait for the 12:05 parade.

119
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:20,440
Wow, this is so much like
my dreams, it's scary.

120
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:26,802
Look at that cute little baby ax.

121
00:10:29,601 --> 00:10:32,935
It's cute, but I'm sure it's
very sharp and probably dirty.

122
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,734
Dirty, maybe. Dangerous, hardly.

123
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:39,391
These are state-of-the-art
animatronic robots.

124
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:44,232
They have sensors that ensure they only
attack each other, never the guests.

125
00:10:58,964 --> 00:11:03,460
See all that stuff in there, Homer?
That's why your robot never worked.

126
00:11:12,728 --> 00:11:17,105
This is just what I was hoping for,
spending the day together as a family.

127
00:11:35,584 --> 00:11:39,830
You know, part of spending time
together as a family...

128
00:11:39,254 --> 00:11:41,710
...is spending time apart as individuals.

129
00:11:41,882 --> 00:11:43,257
Parents' Island?

130
00:11:43,425 --> 00:11:46,675
I'm sure we'll appreciate each other
more when we meet up at dinner.

131
00:11:46,845 --> 00:11:49,716
Are you kids gonna be all right? Kids?

132
00:11:58,315 --> 00:12:01,980
It is the '70s. Right down
to the smallest detail.

133
00:12:02,152 --> 00:12:04,560
Hey, the bartender even looks
like John Travolta.

134
00:12:04,738 --> 00:12:06,814
Yeah, "looks like."

135
00:12:08,367 --> 00:12:12,661
Look at all this great stuff, Lis.
Cool. Personalized plates.

136
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:16,827
Barclay, Barry, Bert... Bort?

137
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,625
Come on. "Bort"?

138
00:12:18,794 --> 00:12:22,293
- Mommy, buy me a license plate.
- No. Come along, Bort.

139
00:12:22,464 --> 00:12:25,999
- Are you talking to me?
- No. My son is also named Bort.

140
00:12:26,176 --> 00:12:29,213
- Who are all these characters?
- You're too young to remember...

141
00:12:29,388 --> 00:12:33,338
...the short-lived Itchy & Scratchy
& Friends Hour. They had to have friends.

142
00:12:33,517 --> 00:12:36,518
There's Disgruntled Goat,
Uncle Ant, Ku Klux Klam.

143
00:12:38,772 --> 00:12:40,231
Oh, yeah. They weren't very funny.

144
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:42,475
I don't know. Disgruntled Goat
had his moments.

145
00:12:58,542 --> 00:13:04,470
Welcome to T.G.I. McScratchy's,
where it's constantly New Year's Eve.

146
00:13:04,214 --> 00:13:10,419
Here we go again. Three, two, one.

147
00:13:18,103 --> 00:13:22,397
It must be wonderful to ring in
the new year over and over and over.

148
00:13:22,566 --> 00:13:24,440
Please kill me.

149
00:13:41,961 --> 00:13:45,376
- The babies look unhappy.
- Add more balls.

150
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:54,137
Roger Meyers Sr., the gentle genius
behind Itchy and Scratchy...

151
00:13:54,306 --> 00:13:57,509
...loved and cared about almost
all the peoples of the world.

152
00:13:57,685 --> 00:14:00,602
And he in return was beloved
by the world...

153
00:14:00,771 --> 00:14:05,433
...except in 1938, when he was
criticized for his controversial cartoon...

154
00:14:05,609 --> 00:14:08,610
..."Nazi Supermen Are Our Superiors."

155
00:14:08,821 --> 00:14:13,233
Among his proudest achievements was
the full-length musical Scratchtasia.

156
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:10,715
Hey, Ma, I'm gonna get me
a picture of this crazy critter.

157
00:15:13,719 --> 00:15:16,800
No flash photography, please.

158
00:15:20,351 --> 00:15:25,130
Roger Meyers’ next full-length feature
was the wildly successful Pinitchio.

159
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:30,142
Now, you be a good Pinitchio,
and don't you lie.

160
00:15:30,319 --> 00:15:32,691
I promise I will never hurt you.

161
00:15:34,323 --> 00:15:37,739
I wonder if this kind of violence
really does desensitize us.

162
00:15:42,706 --> 00:15:44,782
- Wanna get a snow cone?
- Okay.

163
00:15:49,672 --> 00:15:54,547
So, Mr. Itchy, you think you're
God's gift to women, do you?

164
00:15:54,718 --> 00:15:55,881
Don't do it, Bart.

165
00:16:03,894 --> 00:16:06,183
I just wanted to entertain.

166
00:16:07,272 --> 00:16:10,190
Can you believe I keep
getting away with this?

167
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,107
Officer.

168
00:16:19,702 --> 00:16:22,270
Mop-and-bucket man to the
exit of the Nauseator.

169
00:16:22,204 --> 00:16:24,576
Another jumper on the roof
of T.G.I. McScratchy's.

170
00:16:24,748 --> 00:16:27,418
We need more Bort license plates
in the gift shop.

171
00:16:27,584 --> 00:16:31,840
I repeat, we are sold out
of Bort license plates.

172
00:16:33,674 --> 00:16:35,334
I really wish they wouldn't scream.

173
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,219
- Dad?
- I kicked one of those...

174
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:44,177
...stupid Itchy characters in the butt.
- Yeah.

175
00:16:44,351 --> 00:16:46,344
There's just no way
to resist it, is there?

176
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:51,646
I want all five T-shirts to say
"best vacation ever."

177
00:16:51,817 --> 00:16:55,268
Attention, Marge Simpson.
Your son has been arrested.

178
00:16:56,488 --> 00:16:59,158
I'd be terribly embarrassed
if I were that boy's mother.

179
00:17:00,451 --> 00:17:05,658
Attention, Marge Simpson. We've also
arrested your older, balder, fatter son.

180
00:17:09,585 --> 00:17:13,665
I'm so embarrassed, I wish there was
a hole I could just crawl into and die.

181
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:17,706
- Okay, throw her in the hole.
- Please. It was just a figure of speech.

182
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:24,465
You've got to listen to me.
Elementary chaos theory tells us...

183
00:17:24,641 --> 00:17:28,556
...that all robots will eventually turn
against their masters and run amok...

184
00:17:28,729 --> 00:17:32,477
...in an orgy of blood and kicking
and the biting with the metal teeth...

185
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:36,650
...and the hurting and shoving.
- How much time do we have, professor?

186
00:17:36,236 --> 00:17:41,527
According to my calculations, the robots
won't go berserk for at least 24 hours.

187
00:17:45,788 --> 00:17:48,361
Oh, I forgot to carry the one.

188
00:17:48,582 --> 00:17:52,331
- I have nothing to say to you.
- But, Marge, I was a political prisoner.

189
00:17:52,503 --> 00:17:56,168
- How are you a political prisoner?
- I kicked a giant mouse in the butt.

190
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:59,900
Do I have to draw you a diagram?

191
00:17:59,593 --> 00:18:01,965
Oh, for gosh sakes. What now?

192
00:18:11,397 --> 00:18:14,682
Hey, look. This one's coming on to me.

193
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,274
Mr. Robot.

194
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:27,579
You're wrong about that robot
trying to be your friend.

195
00:18:27,746 --> 00:18:31,198
Lisa, don't contradict your elders.

196
00:18:32,292 --> 00:18:36,753
My hair. You chopped off my hair.
Oh, God, I'm ugly.

197
00:18:36,922 --> 00:18:39,413
I knew we should've gone
to the bird sanctuary.

198
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:48,300
I need the biggest seed bell you have.

199
00:18:48,976 --> 00:18:51,301
No, that's too big.

200
00:18:53,355 --> 00:18:54,849
A chopper. We're saved.

201
00:18:55,607 --> 00:18:58,312
Hey, you're the guys
who didn't like our capering.

202
00:18:58,485 --> 00:19:01,190
When you get to hell,
tell them Itchy sent you.

203
00:19:05,451 --> 00:19:08,240
Oh, my. It looks like we're doomed.

204
00:19:09,371 --> 00:19:13,618
Back, you robot. Nobody ruins
my family vacation but me.

205
00:19:13,792 --> 00:19:15,584
And maybe the boy.

206
00:19:35,731 --> 00:19:37,439
Dad, the flash must have
scrambled their circuits.

207
00:19:37,608 --> 00:19:41,392
- What are you, the narrator?
- Just keep taking pictures.

208
00:19:42,655 --> 00:19:44,650
I'll get more cameras!

209
00:19:47,368 --> 00:19:48,945
Smashy-smashy.

210
00:19:49,161 --> 00:19:51,450
I don't approve of that.

211
00:19:58,170 --> 00:20:00,922
Hey, mouse. Say cheese.

212
00:20:02,508 --> 00:20:05,592
With a dry, cool wit like that,
I could be an action hero.

213
00:20:15,229 --> 00:20:17,471
Die, bad robots. Die!

214
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:22,250
- With a dry, cool wit like that...
- Who'd think that visiting...

215
00:20:22,194 --> 00:20:25,278
...Itchy & Scratchy Land would
be our best vacation ever?

216
00:20:25,447 --> 00:20:28,899
- Yeah, best ever.
- Are you two bonkers?

217
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,659
We almost got killed. Not to mention
all the embarrassment I suffered.

218
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:35,321
But, Mom, it's exactly what
you wanted in a vacation.

219
00:20:35,499 --> 00:20:39,579
It brought us together as a family,
we got a lot of good exercise outdoors...

220
00:20:39,753 --> 00:20:41,710
...and we have so many memories.

221
00:20:42,172 --> 00:20:45,422
You know, you're right.
This truly was the best vacation ever.

222
00:20:45,592 --> 00:20:47,300
Now, let us never speak of it again.

223
00:20:48,679 --> 00:20:52,950
As Roger Meyers Jr., the owner
of the park, I'd like to thank you...

224
00:20:52,266 --> 00:20:54,900
...for stopping the killer robots.

225
00:20:54,184 --> 00:20:56,971
And to show my appreciation,
here are two free passes.

226
00:20:57,146 --> 00:20:59,553
- There are five of us.
- Here are two free passes.

227
00:20:59,732 --> 00:21:03,183
- That's better.
- Man, if this is happening here...

228
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,943
...I hate to think what's happening
in Euro-Itchy & Scratchy Land.

229
00:21:10,951 --> 00:21:14,700
Hello. Itchy & Scratchy Land,
open for business.

230
00:21:15,289 --> 00:21:17,994
Who are you to resist it, huh?

231
00:21:18,167 --> 00:21:21,168
Come on, my last paycheck bounced.

232
00:21:21,337 --> 00:21:23,495
My children need wine.

233
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:35,150
I hope you realize now that
violence on TV may be funny...

234
00:21:35,184 --> 00:21:38,220
...but it's not so funny when
that violence is happening to you.

235
00:21:38,395 --> 00:21:41,432
But it would be funny to someone
who was watching us.

236
00:21:41,607 --> 00:21:44,312
No, Mom. He's right. Observe.

237
00:21:48,572 --> 00:21:51,858
Oh, my. Lisa, go to your room.

238
