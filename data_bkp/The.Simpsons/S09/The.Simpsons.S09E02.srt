<i>Don't judge her too harshly, Sergeant.</i>
<i>She was a lonely old woman.</i>

166
00:09:49,989 --> 00:09:53,720
If you must blame someone,
blame me.

167
00:09:53,826 --> 00:09:57,387
That's pretty much what I was planning
to do there, Armin.

168
00:09:57,496 --> 00:10:00,329
Well, that's about it.
And so, for the past 26 years...

169
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:03,891
I've dedicated myself
to living out your dream.

170
00:10:04,003 --> 00:10:06,062
I didn't dream anything
about an aqua suit...

171
00:10:06,172 --> 00:10:09,403
or a lavender shirt,
but you did take care of Mom.

172
00:10:09,508 --> 00:10:12,966
<i>A dagger!</i>
<i>A dagger through my heart!</i>

173
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:15,604
- Here, Mother. Let me help you.
- Get your hands off me!

174
00:10:15,715 --> 00:10:17,808
- Please, Mom.
- You too, stranger!

175
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:21,284
- I'm your son.
- I have no son.

176
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:24,584
Look, lady, you obviously
have at least one son.

177
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:29,024
No! I have one stranger
and one fraud.

178
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:32,529
- Take it easy, Mom.
- I said, back off!

179
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:35,601
You better do as she says.
She's quick with a hatpin.

180
00:10:35,701 --> 00:10:39,535
Uh, well, hey, I suppose
I'll have to find a hotel.

181
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:43,666
I won't hear of it. Tonight you can sleep
on the floor of your office.

182
00:10:45,411 --> 00:10:47,606
## [Whistling]
Hey, Armin.

183
00:10:47,713 --> 00:10:50,580
[Muttering, Clears Throat]

184
00:10:50,683 --> 00:10:53,914
Miss Krabappel sent me. I forged
my dad's signature on my report card.

185
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:56,318
Oh, now, Bart,
you know that's wrong.

186
00:10:56,422 --> 00:10:58,322
I don't see how me signing
Homer's name is any different...

187
00:10:58,424 --> 00:11:00,324
from you using
Sergeant Skinner's name.

188
00:11:00,426 --> 00:11:04,624
[Sighs] I guess me punishing you
would be somewhat hypocritical.

189
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:07,028
Why don't you just write a 30-word essay
on what you've done?

190
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:09,465
Hey, hey, hey.
Easy there, you big impostor.

191
00:11:12,438 --> 00:11:13,962
[Beeping]

192
00:11:14,073 --> 00:11:16,940
So, uh, um, should I
sign my original name?

193
00:11:17,043 --> 00:11:20,444
Just put an "X," then call yourself
whatever the hell you want.

194
00:11:20,546 --> 00:11:22,514
Well, now,
there's no need for profanity.

195
00:11:22,615 --> 00:11:25,846
My name may have changed, but I'm
still the same man I was last week.

196
00:11:25,951 --> 00:11:28,613
Not to us you're not.
I mean, how would you feel...

197
00:11:28,721 --> 00:11:31,622
if you suddenly found out
Ned Flanders was an impostor?

198
00:11:31,724 --> 00:11:34,852
- Who's Ned Flanders?
- My next-door neighbor. Religious guy?

199
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:38,327
- Oh, you mean Reverend Lovejoy.
- No, I don't!

200
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:41,832
What I mean is, to me
you're just a stranger...

201
00:11:41,934 --> 00:11:45,028
- pretending to be something he's not.
- Mmm.

202
00:11:45,137 --> 00:11:47,901
Oh, I'm sorry,
but that's just how I feel.

203
00:11:48,007 --> 00:11:53,070
No, don't apologize.
It's time I stopped pretending.

204
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:57,707
I've called this assembly
to announce my retirement...

205
00:11:57,817 --> 00:12:00,251
effective as of the end
of this sentence.

206
00:12:01,987 --> 00:12:06,924
This sentence I'm speaking...
right now.

207
00:12:08,194 --> 00:12:12,494
- Period.
- [Gasping, Murmuring]

208
00:12:12,598 --> 00:12:16,193
I wrongfully usurped
Sergeant Skinner's position...

209
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:19,135
and I suggest you consider
him to replace me.

210
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:21,729
- Thank you.
- Well, now, I don't know.

211
00:12:21,841 --> 00:12:24,537
Skinner, do you know anything
about being a principal?

212
00:12:24,643 --> 00:12:26,975
Well, it's been
my lifelong ambition.

213
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:29,775
And if a man pretending
to be me could do it...

214
00:12:29,882 --> 00:12:33,147
well, then, logically,
the real me must be far more qualified.

215
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:37,450
- Good enough.
- Armin Tamzariars reign of terror is over.

216
00:12:37,556 --> 00:12:43,188
Now let us welcome our new Principal Skinner,
Principal Seymour Skinner.

217
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:47,657
- Uh, him.
- [Cheering]

218
00:12:57,843 --> 00:13:00,869
Well, before I go,
I've got some personal items for you.

219
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:03,847
You belong to
the Radio Shack Battery Club.

220
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:08,147
Oh, 10 Canadian dollars. That's a souvenir
from your trip to Upstate New York.

221
00:13:08,254 --> 00:13:11,382
[Chuckles]
You've led quite a life, Tamzarian.

222
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:15,722
It's your life.
I just kept it warm for you.

223
00:13:15,828 --> 00:13:18,763
Oh, I nearly forgot.
Your pocket watch.

224
00:13:18,864 --> 00:13:22,061
Mother's picture is still inside.
Take good care of her.

225
00:13:22,168 --> 00:13:24,762
I'll wind her every day.

226
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:31,208
I poached some fish
for your trip, Mr. Tamzarian.

227
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:34,541
They're full of tiny bones,
so I want you to be careful.

228
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:39,641
I will, Moth- uh, Mrs. Skinner.
[Sighs]

229
00:13:39,752 --> 00:13:41,720
Well, I'd better be going.

230
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:47,090
[Sighs]

231
00:13:47,193 --> 00:13:50,629
<i>[Knocking]</i>

232
00:13:50,729 --> 00:13:54,392
Good evening, Edna. I know we were
planning to see a film tonight...

233
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,400
but instead,
I'm leaving town forever.

234
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:59,630
No, please.
I don't care what you've done.

235
00:13:59,738 --> 00:14:01,968
You're still a decent,
honorable man.

236
00:14:02,074 --> 00:14:03,974
Mmm.

237
00:14:04,076 --> 00:14:07,534
- That's the kind of talk that
makes me want to marry you.
- Oh!

238
00:14:07,646 --> 00:14:09,841
But instead,
I'm leaving town forever.

239
00:14:09,949 --> 00:14:11,883
- Good-bye.
- Mmm.

240
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:27,965
Well, it's time to pick up
where I left off-

241
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:30,228
as a no-good street punk.

242
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:35,305
<i>[Engine Starts]</i>

243
00:14:38,143 --> 00:14:41,670
- Principal Skinner?
- Up yours, children.

244
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:49,283
[Laughs] Now, to recap our top story
in its entirety.

245
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:52,118
"The adaptable citizens of Springfield
have opened their hearts...

246
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:55,318
to Principal Seymour Skinner,
who"-

247
00:14:55,427 --> 00:14:59,261
Not that one.
Idiots.

248
00:14:59,365 --> 00:15:01,356
[Cheering]

249
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:05,494
Thank you. Thank you.
I must say, in many ways...

250
00:15:05,604 --> 00:15:08,471
Springfield really beats
the old slave-labor camp.

251
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:11,873
[Cheering]

252
00:15:11,977 --> 00:15:14,377
I admit Sergeant Skinner
seems okay.

253
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,278
But Mr. Tamzarian pulled himself up
from the streets...

254
00:15:17,383 --> 00:15:19,647
and earned our respect
and admiration.

255
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:22,687
- He lied about his name.
- His name doesn't matter.

256
00:15:22,788 --> 00:15:25,416
"A rose by any other name
would smell as sweet."

257
00:15:25,524 --> 00:15:28,254
- Not if you called 'em stench blossoms.
- Or crap weeds.

258
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:31,329
I'd sure hate to get a dozen
crap weeds for Valentine's Day.

259
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:34,399
- I'd rather have candy.
- Not if they were called scum drops.

260
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:37,663
Your new principal
would like to say a few words.

261
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:40,364
Remember, you have to
respect him.

262
00:15:40,472 --> 00:15:42,770
- He's a war hero.
- Ha-ha!

263
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:44,775
Thank you, Chalmers.

264
00:15:44,877 --> 00:15:47,710
Where I come from,
there's no better way to get acquainted...

265
00:15:47,813 --> 00:15:50,839
than by reciting the Pledge
of Allegiance together.

266
00:15:53,585 --> 00:15:56,247
Why don't you lead us, son?

267
00:15:56,355 --> 00:15:59,916
Hey, America-
[Spoken Lyrics] America.

268
00:16:00,025 --> 00:16:01,925
- [Flatulent Sound]
- [Laughter]

269
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:04,825
Well, that's very concise...

270
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:07,865
but it's an insult
to everything I suffered for.

271
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:10,492
Now, take a seat, junior,
and listen to someone...

272
00:16:10,602 --> 00:16:13,469
who gave their youth
in service of their country.

273
00:16:13,572 --> 00:16:16,632
Mrs. Krabappel,
the pledge, please.

274
00:16:16,742 --> 00:16:20,576
You haven't dealt with women
for a long time, have you, Sergeant?

275
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:23,580
Are you asking me out?

276
00:16:23,682 --> 00:16:27,448
- [Siren Wailing]
- Ah, 433rd Street.

277
00:16:27,553 --> 00:16:31,045
My old neighborhood. Hmm.

278
00:16:33,592 --> 00:16:36,652
"Oh, yes. Oh, yes.

279
00:16:36,762 --> 00:16:38,787
Capitol City's nakedest ladies.

280
00:16:38,897 --> 00:16:41,764
They're not even
wearing a smile.

281
00:16:41,867 --> 00:16:45,098
Nod suggestively.
Yes, six. Count 'em.

00:16:52,878 --> 00:16:56,712
[Groans] Seymour, it's 7:30.
Where were you?

286
00:16:56,815 --> 00:17:00,182
- A bar, Mom.
- I don't know what that is...

287
00:17:00,285 --> 00:17:03,482
but on Fridays, you come
straight home after school!

288
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:05,819
Tonight is silhouette night.
Sit there.

289
00:17:05,924 --> 00:17:08,518
I really just came home
to change into a turtleneck.

290
00:17:08,627 --> 00:17:10,527
Seymour, sit!

291
00:17:10,629 --> 00:17:14,156
In the morning.
Oh, Mom, I'm borrowing your car.

292
00:17:22,474 --> 00:17:24,908
- Good morning, Agnes.
- Mmm.

293
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:27,740
Mmm, how's your new son
working out?

294
00:17:27,846 --> 00:17:33,307
That child is the most disobedient,
smart-alecky, middle-aged man in creation!

295
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:37,082
Hello, ladies. Is this the line for people
who wanna bad-mouth Sergeant Skinner?

296
00:17:37,189 --> 00:17:40,818
- And have 10 items or less.
- Twelve, 11, 10. The mars a weenie.

297
00:17:40,926 --> 00:17:44,623
Oh, now, be fair, Edna.
I liked Armin Tamzarian too...

298
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:47,255
but he was at least as big a weenie
as Sergeant Skinner.

299
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:50,995
- But he was our weenie.
- Now, there was a weenie...

300
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:54,300
you could be proud
to call your son.

301
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:58,172
- Did you ever tell him that?
- Hmm.

302
00:17:58,277 --> 00:18:02,475
Okay, once more,
where are we going?

303
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:05,778
- To Capitol City.
- And why are you and the old lady in the car?

304
00:18:05,884 --> 00:18:08,580
We're gonna talk Armin Tamzarian
into coming back.

305
00:18:08,687 --> 00:18:11,747
- And why is Marge here?
- I came up with the idea.

306
00:18:11,857 --> 00:18:14,519
- And why am I here?
- Because the streets of Capitol City...

307
00:18:14,626 --> 00:18:17,288
are no place for three
unescorted ladies.

308
00:18:17,396 --> 00:18:20,991
- And why are the kids here?
- Because we couldn't find Grampa to sit for them.

309
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:26,436
- And why is Grampa here?
- 'CauseJasper didn't wanna come by himself.

310
00:18:26,538 --> 00:18:30,235
- [Chuckles] Fair enough.
- Hello, beautiful!

311
00:18:30,342 --> 00:18:33,869
- In your dreams.
- We'll see about that.

[Snoring]

313
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:41,983
Hello, beautiful.
[Snoring Resumes]

314
00:18:44,389 --> 00:18:49,053
My mind is made up.
I'm not coming back, and that's final.

315
00:18:50,896 --> 00:18:53,524
- Oh, Seymour.
- And I'm not Seymour.

316
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:55,930
My name is Armin.
This is Armirs apartment...

317
00:18:56,034 --> 00:19:00,027
Armirs liquor, Armirs copy of <i>Swank,</i>
Armirs frozen peas.

318
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:02,801
- Can I see your copy of <i>Swank,</i> Armin?
- Yes, you can.

319
00:19:02,908 --> 00:19:06,708
This is Armirs life. Maybe it's not perfect,
but at least I'm back where I belong.

320
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:09,440
I was born a no-goodnik,
and I'll die a no-goodnik.

321
00:19:09,548 --> 00:19:13,006
Seymour! I didn't bring you up
to use language like that!

322
00:19:13,118 --> 00:19:15,746
- You didn't bring me up at all.
- The hell I didn't!

323
00:19:15,854 --> 00:19:18,254
I've been taking care of you
for 26 years!

324
00:19:18,357 --> 00:19:21,383
- I'm the only mother you've ever known!
- But you have your real son.

325
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:23,393
You're my real son!

326
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:25,395
You've been my son longer
than he has.

327
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:28,022
He doesn't need me,
and I don't need him!

328
00:19:28,133 --> 00:19:30,397
You march yourself downstairs
and get in that car!

329
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:32,766
- Yes, Mother.
- And the rest of you too!

330
00:19:32,871 --> 00:19:35,533
[All]
Yes, Mrs. Skinner.

331
00:19:35,641 --> 00:19:38,610
[Honking Horn]

332
00:19:43,215 --> 00:19:46,673
Hey, everybody, look!
Armin Tamzariars back!

333
00:19:46,785 --> 00:19:50,050
- And he's gonna take over the school again!
- [Chattering]

334
00:19:50,155 --> 00:19:52,146
Now, hold on.

335
00:19:52,257 --> 00:19:56,318
Armin Tamzarian is an unsavory character
who played us all for chumps.

336
00:19:56,428 --> 00:19:59,625
All right, all right.
So he's a fraud.

337
00:19:59,731 --> 00:20:04,794
I don't care. His mom doesn't care.
Do any of you care?

338
00:20:04,903 --> 00:20:07,235
- Nope, not me.
- I guess not.

339
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:10,968
You all seem to be forgetting
that I am Seymour Skinner.

340
00:20:11,076 --> 00:20:12,976
This is where I belong.

341
00:20:13,078 --> 00:20:16,343
You can't ask me to disappear
because you like some other guy better.

342
00:20:16,448 --> 00:20:18,575
<i>I gave half my life</i>
<i>for you people.</i>

343
00:20:18,684 --> 00:20:21,209
Arert I entitled
to a little dignity?

344
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:25,349
You're, uh-
You're right, Sergeant.

345
00:20:25,457 --> 00:20:27,652
Well, I don't see
any way out of this.

346
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:30,353
Now, if you'll allow me,
I think I have a solution...

347
00:20:30,462 --> 00:20:36,401
that'll satisfy the town and let
Sergeant Skinner keep his dignity.

348
00:20:36,501 --> 00:20:38,935
- <i>[Train Horn Blowing]</i>
- But I'm a hero!

349
00:20:39,037 --> 00:20:43,064
- And we salute you for it. Now, don't come back.
- [Cheering]

350
00:20:43,175 --> 00:20:45,075
- I'm sorry, Seymour.
- <i>##[Marching Band]</i>

351
00:20:45,177 --> 00:20:49,910
It's nice you're alive, but you're just
not what I'm looking for in a son.

352
00:20:50,015 --> 00:20:52,813
I'm glad you understand.

353
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:56,445
- [Cheering Continues]
- <i>##[Continues]</i>

354
00:20:56,555 --> 00:20:59,149
Well, this is
a lovely gesture, but...

355
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:02,716
we still have to face the fact
that I'm not really Seymour Skinner.

356
00:21:02,828 --> 00:21:05,661
Oh, no, we don't.
Judge Snyder.

357
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:07,755
By authority of
the city of Springfield...

358
00:21:07,866 --> 00:21:11,165
I hereby confer upon you
the name of Seymour Skinner...

359
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,795
as well as his past,
present, future and mother.

360
00:21:13,905 --> 00:21:15,998
- Okay.
- And I further decree...

361
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:18,133
that everything will be
just like it was...

362
00:21:18,243 --> 00:21:20,143
before all this happened.

363
00:21:20,245 --> 00:21:22,907
And no one will ever
mention it again...

364
00:21:23,015 --> 00:21:26,109
under penalty of torture.

365
00:21:26,218 --> 00:21:29,016
[Cheering]

366
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:33,023
- Here, Son. This is yours again.
- Mmm.

367
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:36,526
I've never been happier or
prouder to be Seymour Skinner...

368
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:41,361
but these last few days as that hotheaded
rogue Armin Tamzarian...

369
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:43,696
have taught me
a thing or two.

370
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:47,329
You know, maybe I've been a
little too uptight in the past.

371
00:21:47,439 --> 00:21:51,273
Well, from now on, you're gonna see
a new Seymour Skinner.

372
00:21:51,376 --> 00:21:53,901
- Oh, no, we won't!
- Yes, Mother.

373
00:22:39,491 --> 00:22:41,459
- [Murmuring]
- Shh!
