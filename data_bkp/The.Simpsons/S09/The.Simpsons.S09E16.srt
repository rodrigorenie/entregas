I don't know.

328
00:18:16,295 --> 00:18:19,458
Would you care for
some reading material?

329
00:18:19,565 --> 00:18:21,965
Hmm.
This could be useful.

330
00:18:22,067 --> 00:18:24,501
[Grunts]

331
00:18:27,005 --> 00:18:31,135
So, like a coward, I let Homer
take the rap for the whole scam.

332
00:18:31,243 --> 00:18:34,212
And now the only way
to clear him is to turn myself in.

333
00:18:34,313 --> 00:18:37,476
l- I don't know what to say.
I'm shocked.

334
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:40,950
I mean, you broke the law
and betrayed a friend.

335
00:18:41,053 --> 00:18:43,112
Yeah, you're right.
You shouldn't be...

336
00:18:43,222 --> 00:18:45,850
wasting your time
with a lowlife like me.

337
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:48,483
Moe, don't say that.
You made a mistake.

338
00:18:48,594 --> 00:18:50,892
But at least you're trying
to set things straight.

339
00:18:50,996 --> 00:18:53,658
Yeah, that's true.
That's true, baby.

340
00:18:53,765 --> 00:18:55,790
It'll be hell being
locked away from you...

341
00:18:55,901 --> 00:18:58,927
but I guess
I gotta take my medicine.

342
00:19:00,038 --> 00:19:01,938
Unless-

343
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,565
Unless I send a letter
to the police clearing Homer.

344
00:19:04,676 --> 00:19:08,077
- Yeah?
- Then we go to the graveyard
and steal two corpses.

345
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:11,707
- Oh, my God.
- We switch clothes with 'em
and leave them in the bar.

346
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:15,514
Then we pour
some brandy around, like so.

347
00:19:15,621 --> 00:19:18,784
- Yeah, would you hand me my keys?
- Uh, yeah. Here you go.

348
00:19:18,891 --> 00:19:22,827
Then we light a match. And fwoof!
We start a new life in Hawaii.

349
00:19:22,928 --> 00:19:24,828
- <i>Good-bye, Moe.</i>
- Where you going, baby?

350
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:29,060
- You going to find the corpses?
- Yes, Moe, I'm going to find corpses.

351
00:19:31,069 --> 00:19:33,333
Uh, well, you want me
to come with?

352
00:19:33,438 --> 00:19:35,963
Renee?
Dearest?

353
00:19:36,074 --> 00:19:38,941
[Sighs]
She ain't coming back.

354
00:19:39,044 --> 00:19:41,012
Ah-Ah- Ow.

355
00:19:41,113 --> 00:19:42,239
Uh-oh.

356
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:45,915
Must kill Moe.

357
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:47,918
Wheeeee!

358
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,545
Must kill Moe.

359
00:19:50,656 --> 00:19:52,123
Wheeeee!

361
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:58,655

- Homer, thank God. You gotta help me here.

362
00:19:58,764 --> 00:20:03,360
Oh, I'll help you.
Help you die! Waaah!

363

Oh, boy. Oh!

366
00:20:15,647 --> 00:20:17,581
I really wanna sleep.

367
00:20:17,683 --> 00:20:21,084
I... also sleep.
Good night, Mommy.

368
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:27,453

372
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:51,274
Oh, Homer, I've been
the world's biggest rat.

373
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:53,283
Can you ever forgive me?

374
00:20:53,385 --> 00:20:57,321
Oh, I could never
stay mad at you, Moe.

375
00:20:57,422 --> 00:21:01,882
After all,
you get me drunk.

376
00:21:01,994 --> 00:21:03,894
[Moe] Aw!

377
00:21:03,996 --> 00:21:06,487
Oh, my poor bar.

378
00:21:07,866 --> 00:21:10,892
- It's all gone.
- Aw, Moe, Moe.

379
00:21:11,003 --> 00:21:14,905
Moe, dry those
beady little eyes.

380
00:21:15,007 --> 00:21:19,103

back on your feet.
