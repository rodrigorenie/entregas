I don't know.
That's a pretty big decision.

00:06:12,238 --> 00:06:16,038
Well, if it would put your mind at ease,
I could take a limousine.

Although, that would cost $200.

$200? Oh!
Isn't there any other way?

Frankly, I do.
I know you had your heart set on a limo...

It's so beautiful.

333
00:21:01,627 --> 00:21:04,494
And just think, we are
the first people to hear its song...

334
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:07,929
in more than 4,000 years.

335
00:21:08,033 --> 00:21:11,594
Thanks for making me take
such a stupid risk, Dad.

336
00:21:11,703 --> 00:21:14,171
Anytime, honey.
Just remember-

337
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:17,572
Never be afraid to live life
on the edge.

338
00:21:17,676 --> 00:21:20,474
Now, let's get home
before your mother kills us.

339
00:21:22,347 --> 00:21:24,577
It's kind of humbling, isn't it?

340
00:21:24,683 --> 00:21:28,278
The music we just heard
might never be heard again.

341
00:21:28,387 --> 00:21:30,912
Yeah.
But it'll always live on...

342
00:21:31,023 --> 00:21:33,184
because we'll never forget it.

343
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:35,226
## [Whistling]

344
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:39,692
- Dad, that's the Old Spice song.
- It is?

345
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:43,063
Well, that's a good song too.
