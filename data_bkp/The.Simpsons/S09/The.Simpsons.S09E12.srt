Which one? "Precious Moments"
or "Treasured Memories"?

Kill 'em that way.

We don't wanna kill them, Bart.
We just want our home back.

- No fires!

- There must be a way to outsmart them.

Ah, you can't outsmart carnival folk.
They're the cleverest folk in the world.

350
00:19:31,603 --> 00:19:35,232

- One game of ringtoss.

355

you'll give us our house back.

- Oh, you'll never make it, Dad.

358
00:20:04,136 --> 00:20:08,197
- So, we'd own the house legit?
- That's right.

That Homer fella
grifted you good, Dad.

Well, there's no shame
in beir beaten by the best.

00:20:55,954 --> 00:20:59,822
- But he didn't seem all that-
- We were beaten by the best, boy.

372
00:21:01,226 --> 00:21:05,322
I'm so proud of you, Homer.
You got our house back.

- Mmm.
- Way to go, Dad. You actually outwitted someone.

Ah, I guess your old man
is smarter than you thought.

Ah, look at 'em standing out there,

Poor guys. Hey, what if we let 'em
stay here for just a few days?

378
00:21:22,848 --> 00:21:25,646
