pretty fast to get out there in time.

335
00:17:15,267 --> 00:17:18,236
- Nah, I'll just take the chopper.
- They gave you a chopper?

336
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,940
[Wheezing]

337
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:26,603
- Mojo, will you wipe my mouth?
- [Chitters]

338
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:31,115
Oh, for Pete sakes,
why is that monkey wearing a diaper?

339
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:33,946
- I thought he was housebroken?
- [Both] Meh.

340
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,385
[Groans]

341
00:17:36,488 --> 00:17:40,254
You said this monkey would be
sweeping the floors and cleaning the gutters...

342
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:44,352
and now he just lies there
struggling to breathe.

343

- [Labored Breathing]
- <i>[Homer] What do you want?</i>

344
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,131
His cholesterol's through the roof.

345
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:51,134
I want you to take
that monkey back...

346
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:54,694
so he can be rehabilitated
and get a second chance.

347
00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:57,037
No, no.
He's fine.

348
00:17:57,142 --> 00:17:59,770
Go on, Mojo.
Show Marge your happy dance.

349
00:17:59,878 --> 00:18:02,608

Mojo. What have they done to you?

356
00:18:23,135 --> 00:18:26,627
[Computerized Voice]
Pray for Mojo.

357
00:18:26,738 --> 00:18:31,539
So, by waking up a little early
and having some extra sheets handy...

358
00:18:31,643 --> 00:18:33,770
no one's the wiser.

359
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:36,313
Tomorrow- destroying the evidence.

360
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:39,873
Ew. Uh, thank you, Milhouse.

361
00:18:39,985 --> 00:18:44,149
Now it's time for today's special live edition
of Bart's People.

362
00:18:44,256 --> 00:18:49,125
[Clears Throat]
Lisa, I've just arrived at the Springfield dump.

363
00:18:49,228 --> 00:18:51,128
A lot of things get thrown out here.

364
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:54,631
Sometimes even a human being.

365
00:18:54,733 --> 00:18:56,963
Somewhere in this pile
of twisted metal...

366
00:18:57,069 --> 00:18:59,060
and soiled mattresses-

367
00:18:59,171 --> 00:19:01,662
- [Nervous Chuckles]
- lives a poor immigrant...

368
00:19:01,773 --> 00:19:04,867
whose home was cruelly taken away.

369
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:06,877
Yeah. By you!

370
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:09,379
Groundskeeper Willie!
Um, uh...

371
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:12,109
so you're the immigrant
I'm here to help.

372
00:19:12,217 --> 00:19:14,685
Help?
You destroyed my house...

373
00:19:14,786 --> 00:19:17,584
and reduced me to livir in a dump.

374
00:19:17,689 --> 00:19:19,850
Groundskeeper Willie, furious with
the government that let him down.

375
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:21,892
- I'm Bart Simp-
- <i>[Screams]</i>

376
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:24,963

00:19:27,065 --> 00:19:28,965
- [Crash, Audio Cuts Out]
- Oh, no.

379
00:19:29,067 --> 00:19:31,934
What have I done?
Nelson, cover for me.

382
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:50,887
Oh, Bart. It's me,
a jolly policeman.

383
00:19:50,989 --> 00:19:55,289
Oh, we got Willie. Come on out
so we can give you a medal.

384
00:19:55,394 --> 00:19:57,294
Way to go, Officer.

- <i>[Yelps]</i>

387
00:20:01,633 --> 00:20:04,124
- Willie, stop!
- Away with ya.

388
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:07,672
I got to finish him off
while I'm still temporarily insane!

389
00:20:07,773 --> 00:20:10,571
No, you can't hurt Bart!

390
00:20:10,676 --> 00:20:12,906
He's-Well, he's your son.

391
00:20:13,011 --> 00:20:16,378
- What?
- Well, not literally.

392
00:20:16,481 --> 00:20:19,848
But in a way,
isn't he everyone's son?

393
00:20:19,952 --> 00:20:22,443
For you see,
that little hell-raiser...

394
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:25,250
is the spawn of every
shrieking commercial...

395
00:20:25,357 --> 00:20:27,587
every brain-rotting soda pop...

396
00:20:27,693 --> 00:20:30,127
every teacher who cares
less about young minds...

397
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:33,255
than about cashing
their big fat paychecks.

398
00:20:33,365 --> 00:20:35,833
No, Bart's not to blame.

399
00:20:35,934 --> 00:20:40,200
You can't create a monster and then whine
when he stomps on a few buildings.

400
00:20:40,305 --> 00:20:43,934
- I'm Lisa Simpson.
- [Sniffles, Sobs]

401
00:20:45,477 --> 00:20:48,469
You're right.
It's all Willie's fault.

402
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:51,208
I've been a terrible father.

403
00:20:51,316 --> 00:20:53,216
Hey, Lise. Thanks.

404
00:20:53,318 --> 00:20:56,378
Boy, that phony schmaltz
of yours sure is powerful stuff.

405
00:20:56,488 --> 00:20:59,082
Uh, yeah. But I have
a certain respect...

406
00:20:59,191 --> 00:21:01,659
for that whole "truth and hard work" thing
that you do.

407
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:06,026
You know, Bart, if we combine
your showmanship with my integrity...

408
00:21:06,131 --> 00:21:08,565
we could make kids
really care about the news.

409
00:21:08,667 --> 00:21:12,728
You're right. If we work together,
there's no stoppir us.

Let's power up!

418
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:43,434
I can't believe
they canceled us for this-

419
00:21:43,535 --> 00:21:46,265
Shut up!
