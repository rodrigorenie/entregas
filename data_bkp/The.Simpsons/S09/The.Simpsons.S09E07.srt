00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:52,530
I am really doomed.

336
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:55,072
Only the gods could
stop this wedding now.

337
00:17:55,174 --> 00:17:57,142
Gods, eh?

[Chattering]

339
00:18:03,348 --> 00:18:06,044
No, no, no, no.
No pansies for me.

340
00:18:06,151 --> 00:18:08,119
It's the tradition in India.

341
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:10,654
Yeah, all right.
It'll cover the gravy stains.

342
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:12,849
- Hey!
- Tradition.

343
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:15,051
Thanks for helping us out, Reverend.

344
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,788
I know you've never performed
a Hindu ceremony.

345
00:18:17,896 --> 00:18:20,160
Well, Christ is Christ.

346
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:22,426

- Obviously not.
- <i>[Crashing]</i>

360
00:19:10,182 --> 00:19:15,176
I am the god Ganesh!
This wedding angers me!

361
00:19:15,287 --> 00:19:18,256
All will die unless it is stopped.

362

Stop chasing Ganesh!

You're just gonna get
more wrath!

367
00:19:32,871 --> 00:19:36,272
- Oh. I'm afraid this is all my fault, Manjula.
- [Homer Shouting]

368
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:38,343
To be perfectly honest with you...

369
00:19:38,443 --> 00:19:42,573
I have not exactly been looking forward
to this arranged marriage.

370
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:44,581
Oh. Nor have I.

371
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:48,016
Marrying a complete stranger?
It is crazy.

372
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,680
All right.
Ganesh has been subdued.

00:19:59,298 --> 00:20:03,132
Uh, the answer to all three
is "fried green tomatoes."

You are clearly
so quick-witted and beautiful.

381
00:20:14,913 --> 00:20:17,108
And when I look in your eyes...

382
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:21,346
I see that sweet little boy
who sold me my very first kiss.

383
00:20:21,453 --> 00:20:23,614
And I liked it.

384
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:28,125
Oh. Do you think this marriage
could really work?

385
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:31,162
Who knows?
We can always get divorced.

386
00:20:31,263 --> 00:20:34,096
Of course.
God bless America.

387
00:20:42,341 --> 00:20:45,742
And now, ladies and gentlemen...
