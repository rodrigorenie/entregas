Of course you do.

<i>This so-called "new religion"...</i>

weird rituals and chants...

the money of fools.

Oh, Lord. Uh, try
the emergency plate, Ned.

Our lives are so much better now.

the lima bean harvest.

We get to see the Leader pass by.

00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:33,994
We toil in the fields,

Yes, it would be nice if he'd buy American,
but what are you gonna do?

Actually, sir, with our creative bookkeeping...

- Absolutely, sir.

- You'd kneel before me.
- Boy, would I!

00:11:37,997 --> 00:11:42,434
Yes. Uh, then I'll form my own religion
with its own symbol.

00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:44,765
We'll use this special "K."

I believe that's already

- And people worship it?
- In a way.

Uh, how about this?

But he's no bowl of Special "K."

This is ridiculous.
We're already married.

But, Marge, we're not mass married.

At least you
got to choose your mate.

Yes, Bart?

00:18:42,387 --> 00:18:44,514
Anyone like a draft beer?

325
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:47,421
Beer?
[Salivating]

326
00:18:47,526 --> 00:18:51,121
Would you like
a tall, frosty one, Homer?

327
00:18:56,468 --> 00:19:00,097
[Thinking]
No. Must resist temptation.

328
00:19:00,205 --> 00:19:04,801
[Thinking]
Go ahead. Give in. Beer! Beer!

329
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:08,209
[Thinking]
Ooh. These cotton-poly blends are so comfortable.

330
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:12,477
Go on, Homer. Our commandments
clearly state that beer is all right.

331
00:19:12,584 --> 00:19:14,745
Try some.

332
00:19:17,422 --> 00:19:19,982
[Chattering]

333
00:19:21,627 --> 00:19:24,494
- This man is coming with us.
- <i>Homer, you don't have to go with them.</i>

334
00:19:24,596 --> 00:19:26,427
But I want to go.

335
00:19:26,532 --> 00:19:28,500
Well, I would say
the matter is settled.

336
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:32,468
You know, I pride myself on being a good host,
so I'm obliged to offer you a beer...

337
00:19:32,571 --> 00:19:36,598
but I'm so darn mad
it's gonna be mostly head.

338
00:19:41,446 --> 00:19:43,414
Homer, come back!

339
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:46,643
- That's my husband!
- He's our husband now.

340
00:19:46,752 --> 00:19:49,118
[All]
Yea!

341
00:19:49,221 --> 00:19:51,655
I'm glad I'm back...

342
00:19:51,757 --> 00:19:54,624
because the moment
that sweet, sweet beer hit my tongue...

343
00:19:54,726 --> 00:19:56,557
I was born again!

344
00:19:56,662 --> 00:19:58,960
- [Both Gasp]
- Hallelujah!

345
00:19:59,064 --> 00:20:02,295
Now I can show all of you
what I've come to realize.

346
00:20:02,401 --> 00:20:04,767
The reason we're not allowed
in the forbidden barn...

347
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:07,703
is because there is no
intergalactic spaceship.

348
00:20:07,806 --> 00:20:10,707
He's taken our money
just so he can...

349
00:20:11,743 --> 00:20:14,439
build one hell of a spaceship!

350
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:17,811
- [All Gasping]
- [Leader On Speaker] Homer Simpson...

351
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:23,786
because of your lack of faith,
you've ruined mankind's chance for salvation.

352
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:25,823
- Whoops.
- <i>Nice goir there, Homer.</i>

353
00:20:25,924 --> 00:20:28,950
Oh, my gosh. Maybe he was
telling the truth about everything.

354
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:31,723
Oh, mercy.
He's the real deal!

355
00:20:40,105 --> 00:20:42,096
[Humming]

356
00:20:44,343 --> 00:20:46,368
[All Groan]

357
00:20:46,478 --> 00:20:48,378
Come back.
Come back!

358
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,710
Willie still loves ya, O Great One!

359
00:20:58,223 --> 00:21:01,715
Stranger, you're a-trespassir
on my dirt farm.

360
00:21:01,827 --> 00:21:04,694
Uh, do you happen to need a messiah?

361
00:21:04,796 --> 00:21:07,788
No, but I'll take
them sacks of money from ya.

362
00:21:07,899 --> 00:21:09,799
[Groans]

363
00:21:09,901 --> 00:21:12,995
I should have stayed
with the Promise Keepers.

364
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:16,802
Damn it! It fell apart
like everything else I've ever believed in.

365
00:21:16,908 --> 00:21:19,399
Oh, I guess it's back to
good old-fashioned voodoo.

366
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:23,140
Wow! I need a drink!

367
00:21:23,248 --> 00:21:25,307
Come with me.

368
00:21:25,417 --> 00:21:27,408
Uh, is that your collar, Reverend?

369
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:31,250
Uh, yes. [Chuckles]
How did that get down there?

370
00:21:31,356 --> 00:21:34,416
Come back to papa, baby.

371
00:21:36,028 --> 00:21:39,054
To think, I turned to a cult
for mindless happiness...

372
00:21:39,164 --> 00:21:42,156
- when I had beer all along.
- [Clears Throat]

373
00:21:42,267 --> 00:21:46,067
And you, Marge, the bringer of beer.

374
00:21:46,171 --> 00:21:50,107
- It's wonderful to think for ourselves again.
- You said it, Sister.

375
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:51,835
[Man Announcing]
You are watching Fox.

376
00:21:51,943 --> 00:21:54,912
[Together]
We are watching Fox.

377
00:22:40,425 --> 00:22:42,393
- [Murmuring]
- Shh!
