00:18:09,321 --> 00:18:12,449
Oh, Edna, my sweet buttercup,
you read my mind.

331
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:15,891
Just, uh, give me 20 minutes
or so to finish these tardy slips.

332
00:18:17,362 --> 00:18:19,796
Why we gettir dressed-up, Mom?
Are we going to Black Angus?

333
00:18:19,898 --> 00:18:25,495
Well, you might say we're going
to the best steakhouse in the whole universe.

334

to your stupid Judgment Day.

337
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:39,276
Please, Lisa.
I don't know exactly what's gonna happen.

But I really wish we could
make peace before sunset.

Nothing is going to happen, Mom!

00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:48,958
I hate to disappoint you,
but the world is not coming to an end.

341
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:59,694
Well, shall we sing a hymn?
Uh, "Nearer, My God, to Thee" maybe?

342
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:03,673
