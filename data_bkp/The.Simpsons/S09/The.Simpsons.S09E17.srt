her brairs turning to mush.

337
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:19,962
You know, on account of
the Simpson gene.

338
00:18:20,065 --> 00:18:23,125
Simpson gene?
That's just foolishness!

339
00:18:23,235 --> 00:18:25,760
No. Baldness too.

340
00:18:25,871 --> 00:18:29,898
So please, I beg you,
don't take your brain for granted.

341
00:18:30,008 --> 00:18:32,909
It's the best friend
you'll ever have.

342
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:37,882
[Clears Throat]
Little girl... likes her brain.

343
00:18:37,983 --> 00:18:40,144
What's your opinion?

344
00:18:40,252 --> 00:18:42,447
[Scoffs]
Simpson gene.

345
00:18:42,554 --> 00:18:45,148
Somebody's gotta
set that girl straight...

346
00:18:45,257 --> 00:18:47,487
and I know how to do it.

347
00:18:48,594 --> 00:18:50,653
Marge, get me your address book...

348
00:18:50,762 --> 00:18:52,889
four beers and my conversation hat.

349
00:18:57,336 --> 00:18:59,804
- [Snoring]
- Lisa. Lisa, honey, wake up.

350
00:18:59,905 --> 00:19:02,533
[Yawns]
Why bother?

351
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:05,201
Because your father
has a big surprise for you.

352
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:07,676
- I'm adopted?
- Better. Come look.

353
00:19:07,779 --> 00:19:11,681
<i>Lisa, it's me, Daddy.</i>
<i>Your father.</i>

354
00:19:11,783 --> 00:19:14,946
I rounded up every Simpson
in the tri-city area...

355
00:19:15,053 --> 00:19:19,149
so I can prove to you there's nothing wrong
with the Simpson genes.

356
00:19:19,258 --> 00:19:21,192
This is your great-uncle Chet.

357
00:19:21,293 --> 00:19:23,523
Go ahead, Chet.
Tell her what you do.

358
00:19:23,629 --> 00:19:26,189
I run an unsuccessful
shrimp company.

359
00:19:26,298 --> 00:19:29,529
Oh. But...
you run it, right?

360
00:19:29,635 --> 00:19:31,603
- Oh, yeah.
- Okay.

361
00:19:31,703 --> 00:19:34,570
Uh, this is your
second cousin Stanley.

362
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:37,198
Um, I shoot birds at the airport.

363
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:40,210
Everybody hates birds, right?

364
00:19:41,647 --> 00:19:44,309
[Whimpers]
Well, you look pretty successful.

365
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:47,010
Thanks. I play
a millionaire at parties.

366
00:19:48,487 --> 00:19:50,387
At least I'd like to.

367
00:19:50,489 --> 00:19:54,323
You probably should have
researched this first, eh, Dad?

368
00:19:54,426 --> 00:19:59,022
- What about you?
- Well, sir, I step in front of cars and sue the drivers.

369
00:19:59,131 --> 00:20:01,031
I beg celebrities for money.

370
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:03,567
- I'm a prison snitch.
- Jug band manager.

371
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:06,365
- My legs hurt.
- [Groans]

372
00:20:06,471 --> 00:20:11,204
Oh, Lisa's right.
We're nothing but a big bunch of losers.

373
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:13,437
Show's over, folks. Go home!

374
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:16,981
- What about our five bucks?
- You get it after you leave. Now get outta here.

375
00:20:17,082 --> 00:20:19,482
<i>[Voices Mumbling]</i>

376
00:20:19,585 --> 00:20:22,884
Wait a minute, Homer. You didn't ask
everybody. What about the women?

377
00:20:22,988 --> 00:20:24,888
Fine, fine.

378
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:28,016
What do you do, "Dr. Simpson"?

379
00:20:28,126 --> 00:20:30,458
- Doctor?
- That's right.

380
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:33,622
I'm Chief of Complicated Surgery
at the InvasiCare Clinic.

381
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:35,597
That means you went
to college, right?

382
00:20:35,701 --> 00:20:38,329
You have to if you want to be
an architect.

383
00:20:38,437 --> 00:20:40,405
Or an environmental lawyer.

384
00:20:40,505 --> 00:20:43,406
Or Regional Sales Coordinator
for the third largest distributor...

385
00:20:43,508 --> 00:20:45,408
of bunk and trundle beds.

386
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:48,070
Oh! Did you hear that, Lisa?

387
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:51,946
So all the Simpson women
turn out okay.

388
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:54,018
That's right, sweetie.

389
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:57,816
The defective Simpson gene is on the "Y"
chromosome, so only men are affected.

390
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,914
[Both Growling]

391
00:21:01,026 --> 00:21:02,926
- Yea!
- Yea!

392
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:05,326
So I'm <i>not</i> doomed!

393
00:21:07,399 --> 00:21:10,527
Oh, Dad, I've never been happier
to be your daughter!

394
00:21:10,636 --> 00:21:13,070
Oh, thanks, honey.
Remember...

395
00:21:13,171 --> 00:21:16,971
there's nothing that says you can't be
a Simpson <i>and</i> a success.

396
00:21:17,075 --> 00:21:19,566
Unless you're a man.

397
00:21:19,678 --> 00:21:22,340
So wait a minute.
This means I'm gonna be a failure?

398
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:26,076
Yes, Son.
A spectacular failure.

399
00:21:27,252 --> 00:21:29,220
[Grunts]

400
00:21:29,321 --> 00:21:32,586
Dearest Log: I am me again!

401
00:21:33,859 --> 00:21:36,054
And I feel like
there's nothing I can't do.

402
00:21:36,161 --> 00:21:38,030
Except this stupid braintea-

403
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:38,325
Except this stupid braintea-

404
00:21:47,773 --> 00:21:48,603
[Gasps]

405
00:21:48,674 --> 00:21:50,301
I got it! Whoo-hoo!

406
00:21:50,542 --> 00:21:52,271
I mean, splendid.

407
00:22:40,092 --> 00:22:42,287
- [Murmuring]
- Shh!
