1
00:00:33,172 --> 00:00:35,857
What? Uh-oh. Here
comes the evening rush.

2
00:00:35,957 --> 00:00:37,108
Clear out, fellas!

3
00:00:44,717 --> 00:00:47,550
Oh, what a day.
Good evenin', Moe.

4
00:00:47,653 --> 00:00:49,712
Good mornin', Moe.

5
00:00:49,822 --> 00:00:51,722
Yeah, all right.
Listen up, guys.

6
00:00:51,824 --> 00:00:55,624
The Springfield Police have told me
that 91 % of all traffic accidents...

7
00:00:55,728 --> 00:00:57,719
are caused by you six guys.

8
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:00,731
- l knew we could do it!

9
00:01:00,833 --> 00:01:03,233
Yeah, l know. l know.
But the bad news is...

10
00:01:03,336 --> 00:01:05,327
we gotta start havin' designated drivers.

11
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:08,532
- Are you kidding me?

12
00:01:08,641 --> 00:01:10,609
We'll choose the same way
they pick the pope.

13
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:13,645
Everybody reach in
and draw a pickled egg.

14
00:01:13,746 --> 00:01:17,147
Whoever gets the black egg
stays sober tonight.

15
00:01:20,386 --> 00:01:22,479
Whew!
- Whew!

16
00:01:28,361 --> 00:01:32,092
No!

17
00:01:32,198 --> 00:01:34,063
You got the black one.

18
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:41,936
Hey, everybody,
l'm Peter Pants-less!

19
00:01:45,111 --> 00:01:47,773
l can't take this much longer.

20
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,041
l gotta have a beer!

21
00:01:56,889 --> 00:01:59,983
Oh, no.
Oh, no. Not tonight!

22
00:02:00,092 --> 00:02:02,424
Not tonight!

23
00:02:06,432 --> 00:02:09,890
Are you ready to get Duffed?

24
00:02:10,002 --> 00:02:13,733
- Hey, it's Duffman...

25
00:02:13,839 --> 00:02:17,297
the guy in a costume
that creates aWareness of Duff.

26
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:20,937
Duffman wants to party down
with the man who sent in...

27
00:02:21,047 --> 00:02:24,505
10,000 Duff labels to bring me here today.

28
00:02:24,617 --> 00:02:29,316
l've got a bottomless mug
of new Duff Extra Cold...

29
00:02:29,422 --> 00:02:32,914
for Barney Gumble!

30
00:02:37,229 --> 00:02:42,257
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!

31
00:02:42,368 --> 00:02:46,065
l can't!
l'm the designated driver!

32
00:02:46,172 --> 00:02:49,539
Yeah, that's swell.

33
00:02:49,642 --> 00:02:52,941
Duff wholeheartedly supports
the designated driver program.

34
00:02:53,045 --> 00:02:56,708
Now, who wants to party?
-

35
00:03:08,894 --> 00:03:11,761
Please!
l'm trying to drive!

36
00:03:11,864 --> 00:03:13,923
Hey, let's go to the girls' college!

37
00:03:14,033 --> 00:03:15,933
No. The Playboy Mansion.
Playboy Mansion!

38
00:03:16,035 --> 00:03:21,302
Shut up! lt's my car, and l say
we're going to the lost city of gold.

39
00:03:21,407 --> 00:03:23,307
That's just drunk talk.

40
00:03:23,409 --> 00:03:26,310
Sweet, beautiful drunk talk.

41
00:03:28,447 --> 00:03:33,441
Good night, Barney. Don't forget
to bring back my car back tomorrow.

42
00:03:33,552 --> 00:03:36,043
just slide it under the door.

43
00:03:36,155 --> 00:03:39,647
Yes. Tomorrow.

44
00:03:51,937 --> 00:03:55,805
Face it, Homer, the car is gone.
- Ohl

45
00:03:55,908 --> 00:03:58,741
Barney ain't never comin' back.

46
00:03:58,844 --> 00:04:00,744
Here We are, Mr. Gumble.

47
00:04:02,014 --> 00:04:04,744
Huh? Thanks for the lift!

48
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:06,750
Barney, where's my car?

49
00:04:06,852 --> 00:04:09,787
All l remember about the last two months...

50
00:04:09,889 --> 00:04:12,483
is giving a guest lecture at Villanova.

51
00:04:12,591 --> 00:04:14,491
Or maybe it was a street corner.

52
00:04:14,593 --> 00:04:18,324
So you lost my car, eh?
Well, that's just grand.

53
00:04:18,431 --> 00:04:23,994
l oughta punch you in the nose,
but l have to pick up my kids at school.

54
00:04:32,445 --> 00:04:35,937
Homer, l don't want you driving around
in a car you built yourself.

55
00:04:36,048 --> 00:04:40,280
Marge, you can stand there finding fault,
or you can knit me some seat belts.

56
00:04:40,386 --> 00:04:42,786
Sorry, sorry.

57
00:04:42,888 --> 00:04:45,186
Dad, you got a letter
from the City of New York.

58
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:47,191
Throw it away.

59
00:04:47,293 --> 00:04:50,126
Nothing good has ever
come out of New York City.

60
00:04:50,229 --> 00:04:55,098
'Dear motorist, Your vehicle is illegally
parked in the borough of Manhattan.'

61
00:04:55,201 --> 00:04:58,726
My vehicle!
- 'lf you do not remedy this malparkage

62
00:04:58,826 --> 00:05:00,006
within 72 hours...

63
00:05:00,106 --> 00:05:03,940
your car will be thrown
into the East River at your expense.'

64
00:05:04,043 --> 00:05:07,274
Oh! l don't wanna go to New York City!

65
00:05:07,379 --> 00:05:10,041
Why not?
- New York is a hellhole!

66
00:05:10,149 --> 00:05:12,276
And you know how l feel about hellholes.

67
00:05:12,384 --> 00:05:14,648
Dad, you can't judge a place
you've never been to.

68
00:05:14,754 --> 00:05:16,654
Yeah.
That's what people do in Russia.

69
00:05:19,191 --> 00:05:24,629
lt's time l told you about a chapter
of my life l hoped would be closed forever.

70
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:29,326
l was on my way to the Harrisburg
Coat Outlet to buy an irregular coat...

71
00:05:29,435 --> 00:05:33,667
but it required a stopover in New York City.

72
00:05:37,943 --> 00:05:42,107
All l had to do Was Walk a feWblocks
from the Rort Authority Bus Terminal...

73
00:05:42,214 --> 00:05:44,182
to my train at Renn Station.

74
00:06:08,974 --> 00:06:12,569
AnyhoW, l must'ye looked
at somebody the Wrong Way...

75
00:06:12,678 --> 00:06:17,081
because the next thing l kneW,
l Was running for my life.

76
00:06:34,233 --> 00:06:36,793
And that's when the CHUDs came at me.

77
00:06:36,902 --> 00:06:39,928
Oh, Homer, of course you'll have
a bad impression of New York...

78
00:06:40,039 --> 00:06:42,530
if you only focus
on the pimps and the CHUDs.

79
00:06:42,641 --> 00:06:44,541
Oh, l'd love to see New York.

80
00:06:44,643 --> 00:06:48,170
We could all go with the bus company's
special super-sitter fare.

81
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,180
Nine bucks?
This one's on me!

82
00:06:50,282 --> 00:06:53,547
Great! We're all going to New York!

83
00:06:53,652 --> 00:06:59,022
Lousy Bart and his money.
All right, New York, l'm comin' back!

84
00:06:59,124 --> 00:07:03,220
But you're not gettin' this!

85
00:07:03,329 --> 00:07:06,492
Dad, our baby pictures were in there.
- Don't you start!

86
00:07:10,336 --> 00:07:12,236
Wake up, eyeryone. We're almost there.

87
00:07:19,378 --> 00:07:22,905
That took too long. How come
we had to transfer in Atlanta twice?

88
00:07:23,015 --> 00:07:27,349
l just think we should've paid the extra
$1 .50 and gotten a bus with restrooms.

89
00:07:31,123 --> 00:07:34,889
Hey. Marge, l can't feel my legs.

90
00:07:34,994 --> 00:07:37,462
l can't feel my legs!
- Homer!

91
00:07:37,563 --> 00:07:41,260
Homer, those legs belong
to the man behind you.

92
00:07:41,367 --> 00:07:43,267
Hi.

93
00:07:43,369 --> 00:07:46,600
We're here!

94
00:07:46,705 --> 00:07:49,697
Wow! l feel like such a nobody.

95
00:07:53,178 --> 00:07:55,442
lt's wall-to-wall landmarks.

96
00:07:55,547 --> 00:07:58,880
The Williamsburg Bridge.
Fourth Avenue.

97
00:07:58,984 --> 00:08:00,884
Governors lsland.
- Look!

98
00:08:00,986 --> 00:08:02,977
lt's ZZ Top!

99
00:08:03,088 --> 00:08:06,319
You guys rock!
- Eh, maybe a little.

100
00:08:10,529 --> 00:08:14,226
Now remember,
criminals prey on small-town folk like us.

101
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:18,099
So if anyone asks, we're sophisticated
millionaires from the Ozarks.

102
00:08:18,203 --> 00:08:20,501
Homer, you're scaring the children.
- Good.

103
00:08:20,606 --> 00:08:24,098
l don't wanna spend one extra second
in this urban death maze.

104
00:08:24,209 --> 00:08:26,677
You wait here at the bus station
while l get the car.

105
00:08:26,779 --> 00:08:30,408
The bus station is just
one of the sights we came to see.

106
00:08:30,516 --> 00:08:33,314
We'll meet you in Central Park at 5:00.

107
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:36,013
Oh, all right.
But not a minute later.

108
00:08:36,121 --> 00:08:41,058
'Cause once the sun goes down,
all the weirdos turn crazy.

109
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:43,060
l'm on to you!

110
00:08:48,701 --> 00:08:52,467
'Your yehicle is illegally parked...

111
00:08:52,571 --> 00:08:55,233
at One World Trade Plaza.'

112
00:08:55,341 --> 00:08:58,003
Hmm. Ooh!

113
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:13,681
Wow!

114
00:09:13,792 --> 00:09:15,817
Governors lsland looks
so insignificant from up here.

115
00:09:15,928 --> 00:09:18,453
Hey, immigrants, beat it!
Country's full!

116
00:09:18,564 --> 00:09:20,498
Okay, folks.
You heard the lady.

117
00:09:20,599 --> 00:09:23,033
Back into the hold.
We'll try Canada.

118
00:09:28,841 --> 00:09:30,672
Stupid city!

119
00:09:30,776 --> 00:09:33,176
What the hell is this thing?

120
00:09:33,278 --> 00:09:35,746
Come off.

121
00:09:35,848 --> 00:09:38,339
