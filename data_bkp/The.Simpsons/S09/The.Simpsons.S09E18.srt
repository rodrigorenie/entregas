into this electric chair...

339
00:19:38,243 --> 00:19:41,212
which was deactivated
over 30 years ago...

340
00:19:41,313 --> 00:19:43,406
and, I can only assume, still is.

341
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:44,516
Uh-oh.
We didn't reset the safety switch.

342
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:44,982
Uh-oh.
We didn't reset the safety switch.

343
00:19:51,156 --> 00:19:53,215
He's gonna smell like hot dogs.

344
00:19:53,325 --> 00:19:55,293
- [Beeps]
- Operator, get me Morningwood Penitentiary.

345
00:19:55,394 --> 00:19:57,328
- It's an emergency.
- [Busy Signal]

346
00:19:57,429 --> 00:19:58,327
[Groans]

347
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:00,295
Now, Martha, we've been
over this and over this.

348
00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:02,697
We're too old to start having children.

349
00:20:02,801 --> 00:20:06,237
If you're looking for something to do,
why don't you start a new twine ball?

350
00:20:06,338 --> 00:20:08,306
Come on. A mars life is at stake.

351
00:20:08,407 --> 00:20:10,739
We need to get a message
to the prison.

352
00:20:10,842 --> 00:20:12,742
Think. Think!

353
00:20:12,844 --> 00:20:14,812
Lisa's a good thinker.

354
00:20:16,682 --> 00:20:18,946
That's it. Ralph, you're a genius!

355
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:22,418
Now, as I mime the convulsions
of a condemned criminal...

356
00:20:22,521 --> 00:20:25,820
I remind my staff
not to come to my assistance...

357
00:20:25,924 --> 00:20:29,587
no matter how realistic
my performance may be.

358
00:20:31,163 --> 00:20:33,893
<i>[Bart]</i>
<i>They're getting ready to throw the switch!</i>

359
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:36,058
Come on, Lisa. Hurry!

360
00:20:36,168 --> 00:20:38,830
Let's just pray this hits the prison.

361
00:20:38,937 --> 00:20:41,531
[Whistling]

362
00:20:42,874 --> 00:20:45,434
- [Gasps] Huh?
- [Gasps]

363
00:20:45,544 --> 00:20:48,172
Smithers,
there's a rocket in my pocket.

364
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,748
You don't have to tell me, sir.

365
00:20:50,849 --> 00:20:53,909
[Grunting]
Turn off the chair.

366
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:56,112
- Turn off the chair.
- [All Gasping]

367
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:02,356
"Electric chair is on," eh?

368
00:21:02,461 --> 00:21:07,455
Then the old prison has been
getting free electricity for 30 years.

369
00:21:07,566 --> 00:21:09,466
I'll put a stop to that.

370
00:21:12,004 --> 00:21:16,373
[Grunting, Groaning]

371
00:21:16,475 --> 00:21:20,411
- Yea! Yeah.
- Wow! That was really entertaining.

372
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:22,503
- How did you make that smoke?
- [Groans]

373
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:25,082
- Yeah! All right! Whoo!
- All right!

374
00:21:25,183 --> 00:21:27,481
- Way to go, Ralph!
- Ralph?

375
00:21:27,586 --> 00:21:30,054
But the rocket was my idea.

376
00:21:30,155 --> 00:21:33,318
- But asking you was Ralph's idea.
- You're the man, Ralph!

377
00:21:33,425 --> 00:21:35,791
But surely I deserve some credit for-

378
00:21:35,894 --> 00:21:37,589
[Bart, Homer]
Ralph! Ralph! Ralph!

379
00:21:37,696 --> 00:21:41,462
Ah, let him have this one, Lise.
After all, it's Ralph.

380
00:21:41,566 --> 00:21:43,898
Ralph! Ralph! Ralph! Ralph!

381
00:21:44,002 --> 00:21:46,470
Ah, you've done grand, laddie.

382
00:21:46,571 --> 00:21:50,337
Now you know what you have to do-
burn the house down!

383
00:21:50,442 --> 00:21:52,467
Burn 'em all!

384
00:22:37,956 --> 00:22:39,924
- [Murmuring]
- Shh!
