- Son, I'm afraid that leg is hanging by a thread.</i>

329
00:19:25,828 --> 00:19:27,728
Lubchenko must return to game.

330
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:30,799
[ Chuckling ] Oh, your playing days
are over, my friend.

331
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:34,097
But you can always fall back
on your degree in... Communications?

332
00:19:34,203 --> 00:19:36,194
Oh, dear Lord.

333
00:19:36,305 --> 00:19:39,638
I know. Is phony major.
[ Sobbing ]

334
00:19:39,742 --> 00:19:43,007
Lubchenko learn nothing.
Nothing.

335
00:19:43,112 --> 00:19:45,444
Bart, do your thing.

336
00:19:45,548 --> 00:19:50,952
[ Gulp ] Okay, God. If you did give me
a power, let it work now.

337
00:19:51,054 --> 00:19:55,150
Not just for me,
but for my dad.

338
00:19:55,258 --> 00:19:58,455
Heal. Heal. Heal!

339
00:19:58,561 --> 00:20:01,155
Oh, Doctor! With S.U. behind
and seconds left...

340
00:20:01,264 --> 00:20:06,634
my supply of homespun sayings is lower
than a doodlebug in Aunt Tillie's root cellar.

341
00:20:06,736 --> 00:20:09,830
<i>- [ Crowd Cheering ]
- So we'll- Oh,jumpin' crawdaddies!</i>

342
00:20:09,939 --> 00:20:12,169
<i>Is that Lubchenko
coming back on the field?</i>

343
00:20:12,275 --> 00:20:14,573
Yea!

344
00:20:14,677 --> 00:20:18,044
<i>Bart did it. And they're
gonna try for a field goal.</i>

345
00:20:18,147 --> 00:20:21,048
A field goal?
Hmm, 1 9, 20, 21 -

346
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:23,641
[ Gasps ]
That would win the game.

347
00:20:40,269 --> 00:20:44,103
- [ Grunts ]
- [ Cheering ]

348
00:20:45,608 --> 00:20:48,338
Ohh.

349
00:20:48,444 --> 00:20:51,345
- Aw.
- Ohh.

350
00:20:55,251 --> 00:20:57,845
Ohh.

351
00:20:57,954 --> 00:20:59,945
<i>- [ Whistle Blows ]
- [ Crowd Cheering ]</i>

352
00:21:01,357 --> 00:21:05,259
I did it! I did it!
My leg, it broke off.

353
00:21:07,029 --> 00:21:09,224
- Whoa.
- Yes!

354
00:21:11,467 --> 00:21:13,867
## [ Hums: Heavy Metal ]

355
00:21:16,472 --> 00:21:18,667
Poor guy.
He lost his leg.

356
00:21:18,774 --> 00:21:21,607
Oh, no, no. The fans will whoop it up
with that leg tonight.

357
00:21:21,711 --> 00:21:23,611
You know, drink beer
out of it and so on.

358
00:21:23,713 --> 00:21:26,375
But it'll turn up in the morning,
and I'll sew it back on.

359
00:21:26,482 --> 00:21:29,474
- Will that really work?
- Well, I assume so.

360
00:21:29,585 --> 00:21:34,045
- As long as I have Bart's healing powers.
- Why won't anybody listen to me?

361
00:21:34,157 --> 00:21:38,150
I don't have any special powers.
I am not a healer.

362
00:21:38,261 --> 00:21:40,559
Fine.
More money for me.

363
00:22:26,042 --> 00:22:28,010
- [ Murmuring ]
- Shh!
