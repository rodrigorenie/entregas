Oh, my gosh. Some dropouts must have
overpowered the reverend.

330
00:19:19,389 --> 00:19:22,415
This is a love song about a dude I met
in a sleazy motel.

- [ Gasps ]
- A dude named God.

332

Oh.

#And opened up
a dresser drawer #

338
00:19:42,779 --> 00:19:46,875
# Lookin' for a bottle
but instead, I found a book #

339
00:19:46,983 --> 00:19:48,883
She's talking about the Bible.

340
00:19:48,985 --> 00:19:51,215
- So? She's good-lookin'. Shut up.
- You shut up.

That was a lovely song.

361

- It really got to me.
- Been through some rough times yourself?

362
00:21:00,256 --> 00:21:02,190
I-I recently lost my wife.

363
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:06,159
[ Gasps ] I'm real sorry to hear that.
We just lost our drummer...

364
00:21:06,262 --> 00:21:08,059
to a Pentecostal ska band.

365
00:21:08,164 --> 00:21:10,064
I know it's not the same-

366
00:21:10,166 --> 00:21:13,226
No, I hear what you're saying.
It's always hard to replace someone.

367
00:21:13,336 --> 00:21:16,066
Yeah. My name's RachelJordan.

368
00:21:16,172 --> 00:21:19,039
If you feel like talking,
maybe we could grab a coffee?

369
00:21:19,142 --> 00:21:21,170
Well, that- that sounds
real nice, Rachel...

370
00:21:21,278 --> 00:21:24,042
but I'm, uh, I'm not quite-

371
00:21:24,247 --> 00:21:26,047
I understand.

372
00:21:26,749 --> 00:21:30,048
Listen. We're heading out on tour
with the Monsters of Christian Rock.

373
00:21:30,153 --> 00:21:32,451
Maybe when we get back,
you and I could get together.

374
00:21:32,555 --> 00:21:35,547
[ Chuckles ]
Maybe we can. My name's Ned Flanders.

375
00:21:35,658 --> 00:21:39,118
And I'm here every week,
rain or shine.
