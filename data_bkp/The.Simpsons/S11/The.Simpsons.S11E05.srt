Kids are crazy about tobacco,
but the politicians won't let us sell it to them.

- Well, let's say a hundred-

Emil's looking at Mindy?

Hoo-hoo! I think
something's going on there.

323
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:31,101
Shouldn't we be talking about
the $1 50 million offer?

324
00:18:31,207 --> 00:18:33,801
- Oh, yeah. Let's take it.
- Dad, it's a tobacco company!

325
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:36,777
They make billions off
the suffering and deaths of others.

She's right, Dad.
They can afford a lot more.

- No!
- I'm with Lisa. Let's take 'em to the cleaners.

328
00:18:42,685 --> 00:18:45,813
We all agree that
1 50 million is an insult.

<i>The least we can accept
is 1 50 billion!</i>

But you're gonna make us millions.
Yes, you are!

You're about to launch a terrible evil

Now you can't tell me
nicotine's not addictive!

to pay me the 1 50 million?

Cash'll be okay.
Or stock!
