in the bustling heartland town
of Springfield.

On this unassuming street,
two nobodies...

00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:48,163
named Homer and Marge Simpson
settled down to raise a family.

They almost drove me
to fortified wine.

Then we figured out we could
park them in front of the TV.

41
00:03:11,658 --> 00:03:15,094
That's how I was raised,
and I turned out TV.

00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:18,062
I'd see 'em sitting
on that couch all day long...

00:03:34,847 --> 00:03:37,782
TV families were always
hugging and tackling issues.

49
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:41,752
Homer kept saying he could do
a more realistic family show.

50
00:03:41,854 --> 00:03:44,015
Finally, I said, "So do it.

He bought me a Rolex
and cashmere jeans.

159
00:09:22,128 --> 00:09:26,360
I felt kinda guilty 'cause I was always tryin'
to score with his wife.

160
00:09:26,465 --> 00:09:29,957
So when do we start filming?.
Oh.

161
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:32,037
Even Bart was
throwin' dough around.

162
00:09:32,138 --> 00:09:35,539
He paid me and Carl a thousand bucks
to kiss each other.

163
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:38,109
Hey, did we ever get
that money?.

[Narrator] But reckless spending
and interracial homoeroticism...

00:09:43,516 --> 00:09:47,612
were just volume one
of The Encyclopedia Self-Destructica.

- Even more harrowing were the
events of one April afternoon.
- [Jingling ]

169
00:09:57,797 --> 00:10:00,391
The script originally
called for me to jump the gorge.

170
00:10:00,499 --> 00:10:04,492
But I'd been up all night paying people to kiss,
so Dad volunteered to do the stunt.

171
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,970
Everything was going great at first.

172
00:10:07,073 --> 00:10:09,507
I felt like I was king of the world.

173
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:12,635
I'm king of the world!
Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo!

- Yep. There I go.
- [ Grunting ]

176
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:21,644
then came the rocks-jagged rocks,
hitting me with their jags.

177
00:10:21,754 --> 00:10:25,383
- [ Groaning ]
- [ Narrator] the sequence became
an instant comedy classic.

178
00:10:25,491 --> 00:10:28,722
But what the audience didn't see
was the unfunny aftermath.

179
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:32,457
[ Screaming ]

180
00:10:32,565 --> 00:10:35,932
[ Sputtering, Gulps ]
Mmm.

181
00:10:36,035 --> 00:10:38,560
[ Narrator] Somehow,
Homer became addicted to painkillers.

182
00:10:38,671 --> 00:10:40,571
It was the only way
he could perform...

183
00:10:40,673 --> 00:10:42,607
- the bone-cracking physical comedy...
- Ow! My leg!

184
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:45,040
- that made him a star.
- This is the worst pain ever!

- Ow!
- Stop pummeling me!

186
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:50,173
- It's really painful!
- [ Screaming ]

187
00:10:50,282 --> 00:10:54,241
Why did I take such punishment?.
Let's just say that fame was like a drug.

188
00:10:54,353 --> 00:10:57,686
-[Whistling, Screaming ]
-But what was even more like a drug was the drugs.

189
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:59,690
[Narrator]
But despite their mounting problems...

190
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:03,660
the Simpsons’ star continued to rise,
like a plastic bag caught in an updraft.

191
00:11:03,763 --> 00:11:07,221
[ Lisa Narrating] It was such an honor
to be on the Walk of Fame.

192
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:12,999
I mean, there we were with Hollywood
royalty like Milton Berle and Nelson Mandela.

193
00:11:13,105 --> 00:11:16,802
And just a few stars down
from the Cheerios honeybee.

194
00:11:16,909 --> 00:11:20,811
Awards and honors are great,
but they don't pay the pickle man.

195
00:11:20,913 --> 00:11:24,349
We were earning millions,
but we were always strapped for cash.

196
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:27,977
One time, Lisa bought a first edition
of Susan B. Anthony Man.

197
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:31,853
Her check bounced higher
than Rubber Girl.

198
00:11:31,957 --> 00:11:33,857
[ Narrator]
Where did the money go?

199
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:38,089
Marge lost much of the family fortune
investing in birth control products.

200
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:42,065
I learned something.
When people reach for their diaphragm...

201
00:11:42,168 --> 00:11:45,399
they don't want to see my picture.

202
00:11:45,504 --> 00:11:48,940
[ Narrator]As the Simpsons’ money
dwindled, their expenses soared.

203
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:53,774
From the original group of five,
the cast ballooned to dozens...

204
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:56,814
then hundreds.

205
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:59,510
I 'd never acted before
in my life, but, uh...

206
00:11:59,618 --> 00:12:02,712
if the sea captain
could be in the show, why not me?

207
00:12:02,822 --> 00:12:06,280
I 've even got a catchphrase.
Nyah! Whaa!

Whaa, whaa, whaa!
Now I lost it.

209
00:12:09,528 --> 00:12:12,053
[ Narrator]
then, another bombshell.

210
00:12:12,164 --> 00:12:14,632
An anonymous tipster
alerted Uncle Sam...

211
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:17,498
that the Simpsons were
evading their income taxes.

212
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:22,401
[ Apu's Voice ] Yes, I finked on Homer,
but, you know, he deserved it.

213
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:26,103
Never have I seen such abuse
of the "Take a penny, leave a penny" tray.

Inevitably, the behind-the-scenes turmoil...

222
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:55,530

I literally chewed the scenery.

in the syndicated action
series Renegade.

311
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:28,145
I f Esposito thinks he's gonna muscle us,
he's wrong.

312
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:30,181
I hear that, Renegade.

313
00:17:30,282 --> 00:17:32,182
Let's do this thing.

# I shot the sheriff #

# She didn't do it
She didn't do it #

319
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:51,230
So the next time
you see a sheriff, shoot him.

320
00:17:51,336 --> 00:17:53,327
- [ Gasping ]
- A smile.

321
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:55,737

- Good night, Laughlin.

[Narrator]
Lisa sang too-

324
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:04,342
in a tell-all book
blasting the family.

325
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:06,509
To prolong
the run of the series...

326
00:18:06,618 --> 00:18:09,746
I was secretly given
anti-growth hormones.

327

- [ Groaning ]
- [ Shutters Clicking ]

328
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:14,491
That's ridiculous.

329
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:19,053
How could I even get all five necessary drops
into her cereal?.

330
00:18:19,164 --> 00:18:21,064
What?.

331
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:25,364
In that family,
nobody trusted nobody.

332
00:18:25,471 --> 00:18:28,929
They even brought their lawyers
to Thanksgiving dinner.

333
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:32,602
So, uh, how's everybody doing?.

334
00:18:32,711 --> 00:18:36,112
- You don't have to answer that.
- Shut up, all of you, or I'll sue.

335
00:18:36,215 --> 00:18:38,979
Oh, save it for your next book,
you little snitch.

336
00:18:39,084 --> 00:18:41,450
That's assault!
That is assault!

337
00:18:42,554 --> 00:18:44,715
It was the best Thanksgiving ever.

338
00:18:44,823 --> 00:18:49,283
I mean, emotionally it was terrible,
but the turkey was so moist.

339
00:18:49,394 --> 00:18:52,852
[Narrator] the carcass of the Simpsons'
empire had been picked clean.

340
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:56,799
- [ Squawking ]
- But then came help from an unexpected source.

341
00:18:56,902 --> 00:19:01,396
I knew there was only one person
who could reunite this troubled clan-

342
00:19:01,507 --> 00:19:03,441
my old fraternity brother
Willie Nelson.

343
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:08,506
I'd do anything
for keg-meisterJulius.

344
00:19:08,614 --> 00:19:10,514
So I cooked up
a phony awards show.

345
00:19:10,616 --> 00:19:12,777
[ Alarm Wailing ]

346
00:19:12,885 --> 00:19:15,945
Not again.
Time saver, my ass.

347
00:19:16,054 --> 00:19:19,023
When Willie asked me to be a presenter
at the New Awareness Awards...

348
00:19:19,124 --> 00:19:22,491
I had to think about it-
for about a microsecond.

349
00:19:22,594 --> 00:19:25,529
You just don't say no
to the Red Headed Stranger.

350
00:19:25,631 --> 00:19:29,032
And when I heard it was for awareness,
that sealed the deal.

351
00:19:29,134 --> 00:19:31,728
[Narrator] Would Willie's
fence-mending eggs bear fruit?

352
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:36,934
Or would his olive branch
be torn apart by woodpeckers of mistrust?

353
00:19:38,544 --> 00:19:42,173
that night,
fate wore a cummerbund... of suspense.

354
00:19:42,281 --> 00:19:45,717
[ Applause ]

355
00:19:45,817 --> 00:19:48,513
Thank you, Taco, for that
loving tribute to Falco.

356
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:53,922
And now, to present the award
for Most Violent Rap Group, Homer Simpson.

357
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:55,960
- [Applause]
- Hi.

358
00:19:56,061 --> 00:19:58,928
- And Marge Simpson.
- What?.

00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:01,966
- [Applause Continues ]
- What's she doing here?.

360

- And Bart and Lisa Simpson!
- [ Gasps ]

361
00:20:05,938 --> 00:20:07,963
Hey! What's going on?.

362
00:20:08,073 --> 00:20:12,203
Well, I'll be honest. The New Awareness
Awards are all an elaborate sham.

363
00:20:12,311 --> 00:20:15,974
What?. [ Sputters ]
I knew it was too good to be true.

364
00:20:19,851 --> 00:20:22,718
So this whole thing was just a trick
to get us back together?.

365
00:20:22,821 --> 00:20:26,257
Well, I'm also trying to patch things up
between Van Halen and Sammy Hagar.

366
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:29,259
- [ All ] Hmm.
- But the main thing...

367
00:20:29,361 --> 00:20:31,261
is for you folks to stop
this silly feud.

368
00:20:31,363 --> 00:20:33,661
- Isn't that right, people?.
- [ Cheering ]

[Narrator] the Simpsons'
bitter past was forgotten.

373
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:57,090
and now the future looks 
       brighter than ever for this northern Kentucky  family

374
00:20:57,691 --> 00:20:59,958
We put all the craziness
behind us.

375
00:21:00,058 --> 00:21:03,391
And now it's time to get back
to what matters- the show.

376
00:21:03,495 --> 00:21:05,554
And the Sunday comic strip.

377
00:21:05,664 --> 00:21:08,633
- Which Homer writes himself.
- So you know it's great.

[Narrator] So, whether choking their son
or poking some fun...

00:21:14,072 --> 00:21:17,530
the Simpsons will keep on
gagging for years to come.

- I want to visit a screen door factory.
