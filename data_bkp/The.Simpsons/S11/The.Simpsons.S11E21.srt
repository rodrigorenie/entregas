Hello, Krusty.

307
00:18:40,252 --> 00:18:42,777
Oh, that's funny.
So, Marge...

308
00:18:42,888 --> 00:18:45,686
who's your favorite
Native American warrior?.

309
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:49,022
Crazy Horse!
Whoo, whoo, whoo!

310
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:51,528
[Blathering]

311
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:54,793
All right. Stop it!
Oh, this bit's dying.

312
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,460
Let's go to the
Mad Marge Dancers.

313
00:18:57,569 --> 00:19:01,528
##["Sabre Dance"]

314
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:05,098
- Too soon.
- Oh, I really miss Mom.

315
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:08,941
The kids are saying if you say
"Bloody Margie" five times, she'll appear.

316
00:19:09,047 --> 00:19:11,283
But then she gouges
your eyes out.

317
00:19:11,122 --> 00:19:13,222
I hear she mates with men, then eats them.

318
00:19:14,422 --> 00:19:16,822
I'm sure if Marge were here and not
         crazy, 

319
00:19:17,023 --> 00:19:18,813
she'd be telling you two
to do your homework...

320
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:22,452
- and you to finish washing the dog.
- [ Flies Buzzing ]

321
00:19:22,561 --> 00:19:26,554
[ Panting ]

322
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:30,192
Now let's find out
who this Becky really is.

323
00:19:33,605 --> 00:19:34,606
[ Gasps ]

324
00:19:34,606 --> 00:19:35,971
[ Gasps ]

325
00:19:36,074 --> 00:19:38,042
[ Groans ]

326
00:19:39,144 --> 00:19:41,237
Hmm!

327
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:45,112
I really should read
the whole headline before I react.

328
00:19:47,619 --> 00:19:51,715
Oh, my. I've been so unfair to Becky.
Maybe I am insane.

329
00:19:51,823 --> 00:19:53,950
I mean,
I am talking to myself.

330
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:57,995
You are?. Oh, I thought
I'd made a friend.

331
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:06,403
Becky, I want to apologize
to- Usurper!

332
00:20:12,744 --> 00:20:14,234
[ Karate Shout]

333
00:20:16,315 --> 00:20:18,476
- Why, you little-
- [Bart] Cut. Cut!

334
00:20:18,584 --> 00:20:21,781
Mom, it's great to have you back,
but you walked right into my shot.

335
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:25,084
- Shot?. What are you-
- I hope we didn't scare you, Marge.

336
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:28,057
Bart's just filming a music video
for his class project.

337
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,185
And I'm directing
the "making of" video.

338
00:20:30,295 --> 00:20:35,494
Oh. Well, then I guess there's
a reasonable explanation for everything...

339
00:20:35,601 --> 00:20:38,661
except you cutting my brakes.

340
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:41,261
Oh, about that.
When I changed your oil...

341
00:20:41,373 --> 00:20:43,500
I may have drained
your brake fluid.

342
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:45,804
I didn't say anything 'cause
I thought you’d be mad.

343
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:47,776
Oh, boy. My bad.

344
00:20:47,879 --> 00:20:50,507
Becky, I'm so sorry
I accused you...

345
00:20:50,649 --> 00:20:53,083
of trying to kill me
and steal my family.

346
00:20:53,185 --> 00:20:56,416
Hey, no biggie.
I was trying to steal your family.

347
00:20:56,521 --> 00:20:58,614
I even thought of
a good place to bury you.

348
00:20:58,724 --> 00:21:02,160
Then I didn't have a shovel, so I went to the
hardware store. They have six different kinds.

349
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:07,358
- I was, like, "Later"
- Well, that's a relief, too, knowing I'm not crazy.

350
00:21:07,466 --> 00:21:10,026
So I guess everything
really worked out for the-

351
00:21:10,135 --> 00:21:12,501
- [ Gasps ]
- Mom!

352
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:15,732
- You monsters! You killed her!
- No, they didn't.

353
00:21:15,841 --> 00:21:17,399
- [ All Gasp ]
- God!

354
00:21:17,509 --> 00:21:20,706
We put enough tranquilizers in there
to take down Jonathan Winters.

355
00:21:20,812 --> 00:21:24,509
Oh, I've got too much to do
to take a nap right now.

356
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:26,914
Lisa, get Maggie out
of that cage.

357
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:28,919
And, Homer, since
you're dressed for it...

358
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:32,787
I got some S & M for ya-
scrubbing and mopping.

359
00:21:37,162 --> 00:21:39,790
Thank you.

360
00:22:25,277 --> 00:22:27,472
- [ Murmuring ]
- Shh!
