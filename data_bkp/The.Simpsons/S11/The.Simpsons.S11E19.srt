You know, you catch more flies
with honey than with vinegar. Ow!

Afternoon, folks.
I got a new assignment for you.

Ow! Damn it!

Okay, Bart. I'll sweet talk the sheriff
while you grab his keys.

350
00:20:02,698 --> 00:20:06,429
- What should I do?
- Restock the possum bar.
We're almost out of claws.

351

- Ohh!
- My goodness.

352
00:20:09,105 --> 00:20:12,370
What a lovely suit, Sheriff.
Is that seersucker?

353
00:20:12,475 --> 00:20:15,672
Nah. Not on a civil servant's salary.
It's near-sucker.

354
00:20:15,778 --> 00:20:18,838
Well, the fabric really brings out
the red in your neck.

355

Yup. It's coming along, huh?

You should see it in August after
the horseflies been getting at it. Hoo-man!

357
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:28,714
Dang, I wish I could. But in August,
our chain gang has to dig for tar.

Well, now.

Well, don't that beat all?
I guess you folks just stunned him.

372
00:21:09,632 --> 00:21:13,033
That's what we've been trying to tell you!

373
00:21:13,136 --> 00:21:15,366
Well, looks like you folks
are free to go.

374
00:21:15,471 --> 00:21:17,837
But don't you set foot
in the state of Florida again.

375
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:21,967
Fine. There are plenty of other states
that are happy to have us.
