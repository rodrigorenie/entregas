and you can go home to-

307
00:18:28,674 --> 00:18:32,337
- Oh, my Lord!
- Well, it has been a week.

308
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:35,208
Code blue! A thousand c.c.'s
of leg wax! Stat!

309
00:18:35,314 --> 00:18:39,717
Lazy, no-good lepers.
Making me clean everything myself.

310
00:18:39,818 --> 00:18:42,252
- [ Rings ]
- [ Moe ] Hey, uh, is Homer there?.

311
00:18:42,354 --> 00:18:44,822
No, he isn't.
I don't know where he is.

312
00:18:44,923 --> 00:18:48,415
I'm a little worried. He usually stops in
for an eye-opener on the way to work.

313
00:18:48,527 --> 00:18:50,222
He told us
he'd been going to the gym.

314
00:18:50,329 --> 00:18:52,388
[ Chuckles ]
Wow.

315
00:18:52,498 --> 00:18:55,023
Anyway, you don't think he could be
at another bar, do you?.

316
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:59,002
Because I couldn't take that.
I- I just couldn't. I- [ Sobbing ]

317
00:18:59,104 --> 00:19:02,073
[ Sobbing Continues ]
Don't hang up on me.

318
00:19:02,174 --> 00:19:06,543
I'm home, everybody!
Gee, the house looks great.

319
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:10,513
- Mom, I lost Dad and Bart.
- Lost them?. What do you mean?.

320
00:19:10,616 --> 00:19:13,346
I tricked them into thinking
they had leprosy.

321
00:19:13,452 --> 00:19:17,513
Hansen's disease. You know,
like that horrible cream soda.

322
00:19:17,623 --> 00:19:21,286
Well, Dad and Bart ran away,
and no one seems to know where they went.

323
00:19:21,393 --> 00:19:24,658
Okay. Okay. Calm down.
They couldn't have gone too far.

324
00:19:24,763 --> 00:19:27,197
- Molokai?.
- You mean Hawaii?.

325
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:30,860
Mm-hmm. That's the one.
They've got a top-notch leper colony there...

326
00:19:30,969 --> 00:19:32,903
so we shipped 'em right off.

327
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:37,305
Cost us a bundle too. I guess we'll have
an imagination Christmas this year.

328
00:19:37,409 --> 00:19:39,570
[ Together]
Yea! Imagination Christmas!

329
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:42,875
- I got a pogo stick.
- I got a hula hoop.

330
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:53,125
Ew!

331
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:54,023
Ew!

332
00:19:54,126 --> 00:19:57,152
- Whoa! This is a hospital?.
- That it is.

333
00:19:57,262 --> 00:20:00,459
[Birds Chirping]

334
00:20:00,566 --> 00:20:03,626
We'll take the cure,
bag a few lobsters...

335
00:20:03,735 --> 00:20:06,101
then watch some gay guys
get married.

336
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:08,400
- Ah, you must be the Simpsons.
- Howdy.

337
00:20:08,507 --> 00:20:10,532
And thanks for not
recoiling in horror.

338
00:20:10,642 --> 00:20:13,577
- Thankyou for the friendly howdy.
- Can we get a room with a view?.

339
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:17,672
Oh, you'll have a great view of the whole
beach from the electric needle room.

340
00:20:17,783 --> 00:20:21,651
- Really?. The whole beach?.
- Yes. From the electric needle room.

341
00:20:21,753 --> 00:20:23,653
Electric needle room?.

342

- Glad that's not me.

345
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:44,506
- [ Dings ]
- Time to turn over.

346
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:46,601
Here they are.

347
00:20:46,712 --> 00:20:50,011
Oh, thank God you're all right.

348
00:20:50,115 --> 00:20:54,518
Dad, Bart, I played a horrible trick on you,
and I'm really sorry.

349
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:56,986
You don't have leprosy.
It's just oatmeal.

350
00:20:57,089 --> 00:21:00,354
- Yeah, we know.
- I figured it out after I ate one of my chest sores.

351
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:01,983
Well, then let's get out of here.

352
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:06,224
- No way. We scored a free Hawaiian vacation.
- This place is a blast.

353
00:21:06,331 --> 00:21:09,198
All we have to do is endure
two hours of blinding pain.

354
00:21:09,301 --> 00:21:12,134
Then it's nothing
but shopping and surfing.

355
00:21:12,237 --> 00:21:14,432
Tonight we're gonna
put our fake sores back on...

356
00:21:14,539 --> 00:21:16,666
then jump the fence at Club Med
and scare the normals.

357
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:18,834
Well, it all sounds lovely, but-

358
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:22,072
Come on. Loosen up.
This is paradise.

[ Man ] Number one,
report to the dermabrasion hut.
