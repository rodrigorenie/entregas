Mr. C. Montgomery Burns.

I'll keep it short and sweet.

Family, religion, friendship.

34

These are the three demons you must slay

When opportunity knocks, you don't want to be

Or synagogue.

Hard work or stick-to-itiveness?

- Are there any real questions?
- Yes.

43

Um, does your plant
have a recycling program?

44

Re-cy-cling?

45
00:02:50,136 --> 00:02:53,833
I'm afraid I'm not familiar with that term,
you adorable little ragamuffin.

46

Hmm. You never heard of recycling?

47
00:02:56,309 --> 00:02:59,244
It means to reuse things
to conserve our natural resources.

48
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:03,042
Oh, so Mother Nature needs a favor.
Well, maybe she should have thought of that...

49
00:03:03,149 --> 00:03:05,982
when she was besetting us with droughts
and floods and poison monkeys.

50
00:03:06,085 --> 00:03:09,646
Nature started the fight for survival,
and now she wants to quit because she's losing.

51
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:11,656
Well, I say hard cheese.

52
00:03:11,758 --> 00:03:15,194
- But nature's not our enemy.
- Well, surely you agree we can do without her.

53
00:03:15,295 --> 00:03:17,991
- No, I don't agree.
- No?

54

How dare you question Mr. Burns.

I'll handle it, Smithers.
[Chuckles] Shut up, little girl.

tell me about this market crash?

75
00:04:35,642 --> 00:04:38,839
Um, well, sir,
it happened 25 years before I was born.

Oh, that's your excuse
for everything.

I've got to do something
to get my money back quickly.

78
00:04:43,349 --> 00:04:45,681

trading strategy.

00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:49,915
- [All] Good idea, sir.
- Take 50% of my money,

right again, eh, boys?

too gutless to tell me. Isn't that right?

- Dead on, sir.

102
00:06:03,463 --> 00:06:06,728
Then I'll fix this myself. Smithers,
take out another mortgage on the plant.

He's, uh, talking
to the ketchup now.

166
00:10:05,037 --> 00:10:10,532
- Burns is sure acting nutty.
- Maybe going broke and losing
his plant destroyed his brain.

00:10:10,643 --> 00:10:13,111
Could you come along with us, sir?

168
00:10:13,212 --> 00:10:15,976
Are you here to solve
my ketchup problem?

Yes. That's right.

That's the activity room.
We're not allowed in there.

That's the library.
Not allowed in there either.

going in the game room.

How are we supposed to pass the time?

Yes. Thank you, everyone.
But... 10% of your applause...

moralizing, we would not be here today...

287

the Li'I Lisa Recycling Plant.

Oh, ain't that cute?

289

The whole plant
is environmentally sound.

293
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:35,285
It's powered by old newspapers,
the machinery is made entirely of used cans...

294
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:39,153
and the windows are from
the old liquor bottles we collected.

295
00:17:39,258 --> 00:17:42,853

to stop licking my windows.

I know. You told me.

297
00:17:44,963 --> 00:17:49,593

"Barney, you're not gonna lick that man's-"

I'm so proud of you, Mr. Burns.
You're getting your fortune back...

and you're doing it without
endangering the planet...

Oh, hold your accolades
till the end of the tour.

You haven't seen the best part.

303
00:18:02,481 --> 00:18:05,814
I couldn't watch your demonstration
of the fish caught in the plastic rings...

304
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:07,818
without getting an idea.

305
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,013
Look out over the water.

306
00:18:13,659 --> 00:18:16,719
I figured if one six-pack
holder will catch one fish...

307
00:18:16,829 --> 00:18:20,321
a million sewn together
will catch a million fish.

Oh! You haven't changed at all!

to be good, you're even more evil.

323
00:19:08,514 --> 00:19:13,281
I don't understand.
Pigs need food. Engines need coolant.

324

Dynamiters need dynamite.
I'm supplying it to them at a tidy profit.

00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:20,124
And not a single
sea creature was wasted.

326
00:19:20,225 --> 00:19:22,625
- You inspired it all, Li'I Lisa.
- [Gasping]

327
00:19:22,728 --> 00:19:25,128
[Gasps]
Oh!

328
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:27,255
You-
[Panting]

329
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:33,794
Stop! Don't recycle! It's murder!
You're helping Mr. Burns!

330
00:19:33,906 --> 00:19:36,636
[Monotone]
But you told us to recycle.

331
00:19:36,742 --> 00:19:39,142
[Monotone]
You convinced us it was good.

332
00:19:39,244 --> 00:19:43,146
No. It's evil.
Please! Stop recycling!

333
00:19:45,284 --> 00:19:49,687
[Monotone]
Stop. You can't mix plastic with paper.

334
00:19:51,657 --> 00:19:53,557
[Grunts, Gasps]

335
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:56,150
<i>Oh! Oh!</i>

336
00:19:56,261 --> 00:19:58,229
<i>[Tires Screech]</i>

337
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:01,026
<i>[Horns Honking]</i>

338
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:03,192
[Sobbing]

339
00:20:03,302 --> 00:20:07,033
[Groans]
I can't get the smell of slurry out of my clothes.

340
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:11,166
Oh, I was a fool to help
that horrible old man.

341
00:20:11,276 --> 00:20:13,471
I hope you learned
your lesson, Lisa.

342
00:20:13,579 --> 00:20:16,639
- Never help anyone.
<i>- [Doorbell Rings]</i>

343
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:23,281
Simpson, what are you doing here?
Why aren't you at work?

344
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:26,721
I made a bad mistake and Lenny
sent me home to think about what I did.

345
00:20:26,825 --> 00:20:29,191
But I don't remember what
it was, so I'm watching TV.

346
00:20:29,294 --> 00:20:31,194
Well, Lenny's
reign of terror is over.

347
00:20:31,296 --> 00:20:33,389
Mr. Burns bought the plant back
this morning. And-

348
00:20:33,498 --> 00:20:35,398
Enough chitchat.
I need to see Lisa.

349
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,400
I don't want to
talk to you, Mr. Burns.

350
00:20:37,502 --> 00:20:39,402
Oh, I think you will.

351
00:20:39,504 --> 00:20:45,067
You see, I've just sold
the Li'I Lisa Recycling Plant for $120 million.

352
00:20:45,177 --> 00:20:48,203
- Congratulations.
- Oh, don't congratulate me.

353
00:20:48,313 --> 00:20:50,406
Congratulate Bay State Fish Sticks.

354
00:20:50,515 --> 00:20:53,313
As my adviser,
you're entitled to 10% of the proceeds.

355
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:55,318
[All Gasp]

356
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:58,787
Lise, have I told you
lately that I love you?

357
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:03,020
Wow. I've never seen so much money.

358
00:21:03,128 --> 00:21:08,122
Oh, but I can't accept that,
knowing where it came from.

359
00:21:08,233 --> 00:21:10,167
Can I, Mom?

360
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:15,764
[Groans] Lisa, you do whatever
your conscience tells you.

361
00:21:15,874 --> 00:21:18,206
[Moans]

362
00:21:21,146 --> 00:21:23,080
[Groans]

363
00:21:23,181 --> 00:21:26,548
Oh, you did the right thing,
sweetheart.

00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,213
- [Beeping]
- [Laughing]

365
00:21:30,322 --> 00:21:32,347
Well, that's the first case
I've ever seen...

366
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:35,426
of a man suffering four
simultaneous heart attacks.

367
00:21:35,527 --> 00:21:37,518
I'm sorry, Dad.

368
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:40,962
It's all right.
I understand.

369
00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:44,194
But we really could have
used that $12,000.

370
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:49,036
Um, Dad, 10% of $120 million
isn't 12,000.

371
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:51,041
It's-

372
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:54,112

<i>- [Woman On P.A.] Code blue. Code blue.</i>
