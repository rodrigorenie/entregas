Thank goodness you're safe.

339
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:57,356
- Marge?
- I woke up, and you weren't
there, and I was so worried.

340
00:19:57,462 --> 00:20:01,296
Really? You were?
But how did you find me?

341
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:04,267
Well, I was sure you'd be on foot...

342
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:07,736
because you always say
public transportation is for losers.

343
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:12,742
And I was sure you'd head west
because Springfield slopes down that way.

344
00:20:12,844 --> 00:20:14,778
And then I saw the lighthouse...

345
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,872
and I remembered how
you love blinking lights...

346
00:20:17,983 --> 00:20:19,917
like the one on the waffle iron.

347
00:20:20,018 --> 00:20:22,748
Or that little guy
on the Don't Walk sign.

348
00:20:22,854 --> 00:20:26,585
- Yeah.
- Wow, Marge. You really do understand me.

349
00:20:26,692 --> 00:20:29,752
- See, I thought we weren't soul mates because-
- We had a fight?

350
00:20:29,861 --> 00:20:32,989
Right. And we don't like the same things.
It's like you're from Venus-

351
00:20:33,098 --> 00:20:36,864
- And you're from Mars.
- Oh, sure. Give me the one with all the monsters.

352
00:20:36,969 --> 00:20:39,335
Homer, don't you see?

353
00:20:39,438 --> 00:20:41,531
Our differences are only skin deep.

354
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:45,269
But our "sames"
go right down to the bone.

355
00:20:45,377 --> 00:20:49,507
- Maybe we do have a-
- A profound, mystical understanding?

356
00:20:49,615 --> 00:20:51,947
Hey! We do!

357
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:53,950
Oh, Marge!

358
00:20:54,052 --> 00:20:56,748
We're number one!
We're number one!

359
00:20:56,855 --> 00:20:58,982
In your face, space coyote!

360
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:00,991
- Space coyote?
<i>- [Ship Horn Blows]</i>

361
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:04,153
- Oh, my God! The ship!
- [Marge Gasps]

362
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:07,198
- We'll all be killed!
- The light! We gotta get the light back on!

363
00:21:15,307 --> 00:21:18,538
Jonathan Livingston Seagull!
We're on a collision course!

364
00:21:18,644 --> 00:21:20,669
- Hard to starboard!
- Uh, port?

365
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:22,679
Aye. Port.

366
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:27,274
They see us.
They're starting to turn.

367
00:21:27,386 --> 00:21:31,083
- We did it!
- We sure did...

368
00:21:31,189 --> 00:21:33,157
soul mate.

369
00:21:33,258 --> 00:21:36,250
Mmm!

371
00:21:43,602 --> 00:21:45,593
Look at all them hot pants.

372
00:21:45,704 --> 00:21:49,572
- Hey! [Recites Lyric]
