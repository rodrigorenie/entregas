has captured the Beer Baron.

326
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:38,502
- [Murmuring]
- They captured Homer?

327
00:19:39,945 --> 00:19:42,209
Then the liquor-filled
bowling balls...

328
00:19:42,314 --> 00:19:44,612
traveled through a network
of underground pipes...

329
00:19:44,716 --> 00:19:47,742
finally emerging
at a nearby speakeasy.

330
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:50,788
- You forgot one thing, Wiggum.
- Yeah, what's that?

331
00:19:50,889 --> 00:19:53,790
I filled the balls with a funnel.

332
00:19:53,892 --> 00:19:57,851
That was a very sweet thing you did
for poor Wiggum.

333
00:19:57,963 --> 00:19:59,954
But what's gonna happen to you?

334
00:20:00,065 --> 00:20:02,499
Oh, probably just a slap on the wrist.

335
00:20:02,601 --> 00:20:05,434
<i>"A nd he who shall violate this law...</i>

336
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:07,528
shall be punished by catapult."

337
00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:10,574
[Straining]
Last time I help you.

338
00:20:10,676 --> 00:20:12,576
Sorry. I thought you'd get a fine...

339
00:20:12,678 --> 00:20:14,578
or at most,
three, four years in jail.

340
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:18,878
<i>Hold it! This machine is two centuries old.</i>
<i>Better test it first.</i>

341
00:20:18,984 --> 00:20:20,952
Oh!

342
00:20:23,155 --> 00:20:25,350
- [Screeching]
- Okay, go ahead.

343
00:20:25,457 --> 00:20:28,449
Wait! Wait!
You can't do this!

344
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:32,257
All my husband did was violate a law
that doesn't make sense.

345
00:20:32,364 --> 00:20:36,562
Now, I'll admit, car crashes and fistfights
have been down recently...

346
00:20:36,668 --> 00:20:39,364
but prohibition
has cost us our freedom-

347
00:20:39,471 --> 00:20:41,496
our freedom to drink!

348
00:20:41,607 --> 00:20:43,871
- [Cheering]
- Now, hold on a minute, missy.

349
00:20:43,976 --> 00:20:46,945
It's not up to us to choose
which laws we want to obey.

350
00:20:47,045 --> 00:20:50,845
If it were, I'd kill everyone
who looked at me cockeyed!

351
00:20:50,949 --> 00:20:54,783
<i>- Our laws are in place for a reason.</i>
- Send him back to Mama, boys.

352
00:20:54,886 --> 00:20:58,413
[Yelling]

353
00:20:58,523 --> 00:21:02,755
That was unexpected. Well, reset the catapult,
and let's get this over with.

354
00:21:04,196 --> 00:21:07,893
<i>Wait! I have discovered</i>
<i>more lines on the parchment.</i>

355
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:13,063
It says that the prohibition law
which was passed here 200 years ago...

356
00:21:13,171 --> 00:21:16,732
was repealed 199 years ago.

357
00:21:16,842 --> 00:21:18,742
Release the prisoner!

358
00:21:19,978 --> 00:21:21,878
Oh!

359
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:24,778
On behalf of the city,
I'd like to apologize and ask...

360
00:21:24,883 --> 00:21:28,216
how long it will take for you
to flood this town with booze again?

361
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:32,313
Well, sorry. I'm not
in that business anymore.

362
00:21:32,424 --> 00:21:34,324
Four minutes.

363
00:21:34,426 --> 00:21:37,122
<i>[Narrator] And so one town's</i>
<i>briefflirtation with prohibition...</i>

364
00:21:37,229 --> 00:21:39,789
<i>ended in a joyous remarriage</i>
<i>to Lady Liquor.</i>

365
00:21:39,898 --> 00:21:44,358
<i>Congratulations, Springfield.</i>
<i>We wish you the very best!</i>

366
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:48,838
To alcohol,
the cause of and solution to...

367
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:51,170
all of life's problems.

368
00:21:51,276 --> 00:21:53,506
[Cheering]

369
00:22:40,292 --> 00:22:42,692
- [Murmuring]
- Shh!
