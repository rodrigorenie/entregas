let this happen?

338
00:18:05,984 --> 00:18:07,918
You were supposed to be
the night watchman.

339
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:10,682
I was watching.
I saw the whole thing.

340
00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:14,555
First it started falling over,
and then it fell over.

341
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:18,790
Wow. I wonder where
all the rats are gonna go.

342
00:18:18,897 --> 00:18:20,922
[Chittering]

343

<i>[Moe] Okay, everybody tuck</i>
<i>your pants into your socks.</i>

344
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:33,733
And the bold new ideas these
tiny tykes unveil for us today...

345
00:18:33,846 --> 00:18:36,508
could make thousands
of jobs like yours...

346
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:38,515
obsolete.

<i>[Scattered Applause]</i>

348
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:45,120
Our first little genius
is Ralph Wiggum.

349
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:49,018
[Chuckles]
It's pretty good, sir.

350
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:52,726
Hot tub, media room-

351
00:18:52,831 --> 00:18:56,130
It's supposed to be a power plant,
not Aunt Beulah's bordello.

352
00:18:56,235 --> 00:18:58,328
Thank you. Get out.

353
00:18:58,437 --> 00:19:00,337
Next.

354
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:03,306
<i>[Wiggum]</i>
<i>Uh, Ralphie, get off the stage, sweetheart.</i>

355
00:19:08,614 --> 00:19:12,106
Behold-The power plant of the future...

356
00:19:12,217 --> 00:19:14,117
today.

357
00:19:14,219 --> 00:19:16,847
[Groans]
Too cold and sterile.

358
00:19:16,955 --> 00:19:19,116
Where's the heart?

359
00:19:19,224 --> 00:19:24,218
But it really generates power.
It's lighting this room right now.

360

<i>[Electronic Whine]</i>

361
00:19:26,398 --> 00:19:30,061
You lose. Get off my property.
Let's have the next child.

362
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,070
Look, everybody.

363
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:35,197
Simpson's in a contest with children.

364
00:19:35,307 --> 00:19:37,798
- Hey, shh!
- You're making us miss the contest.

365
00:19:39,645 --> 00:19:42,136
Could you explain
your model, young man?

366
00:19:42,247 --> 00:19:45,739
- What's to explain? He's an idiot!
- [Lenny] Pipe down!

367
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:49,719
Well, basically, I just
copied the plant we have now.

368
00:19:49,821 --> 00:19:53,917
- Hmm.
- Then I added some fins to lower wind resistance-

369
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:57,052
And this racing stripe here,
I feel is pretty sharp.

370
00:19:57,162 --> 00:19:59,790
Agreed. First prize.

371
00:19:59,898 --> 00:20:01,866
- What?
- Way to go, Homer.

372
00:20:01,967 --> 00:20:05,562
- You're number one, Homer.
- But this was a contest for children!

373
00:20:05,671 --> 00:20:08,367
Yeah-And Homer
beat their brains out.

374
00:20:08,473 --> 00:20:11,306
[Cheers, Applause]

375
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:14,402
I can't stand it any longer.
This whole plant is insane.

376
00:20:14,513 --> 00:20:16,447
Insane, I tell you!

377
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:19,312
[Stammers, Screams]

378
00:20:19,418 --> 00:20:21,648
[Whimpering]

379
00:20:21,753 --> 00:20:24,221
I can be lazy too. Look at me.

380
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:27,417
Hi. I'm a worthless employee,
just like Homer Simpson.

381
00:20:27,526 --> 00:20:29,494
Give me a promotion.

382
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:34,592
Ooh, I eat like a slob,
but nobody minds.

383

<i>I'm peeing on the seat.</i>
<i>Give me a raise.</i>

385
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:45,609
Now I'm returning to work
without washing my hands-

386
00:20:45,711 --> 00:20:49,807
But it doesn't matter,
because I'm Homer Simpson.

387
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:53,612
I don't need to do my work,
'cause someone else will do it for me.

388
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:55,619
D'oh, d'oh, d'oh.

389
00:20:55,721 --> 00:20:57,916
- Hey, you okay, Grimey?
- I'm better than okay.

390
00:20:58,023 --> 00:21:01,117
- I'm Homer Simpson.
- [Laughs] You wish.

391
00:21:01,226 --> 00:21:04,718
Oh, hi, Mr. Burns.
I'm the worst worker in the world.

392
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:08,823
Time to go home to my mansion
and eat my lobster.

393
00:21:10,235 --> 00:21:13,204
What's this?
"Extremely high voltage."

394
00:21:13,305 --> 00:21:16,763
Well, I don't need safety gloves,
because I'm Homer Simp-

<i>Frank Grimes-</i>

or "Grimey," as he liked to be called-

397

taught us that a man
can triumph over adversity...

398
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:32,355
and even though Frank's...

399
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:36,553
agonizing struggle through life
was tragically cut short...
