327
00:19:58,564 --> 00:20:02,125
[Laughs]
Very funny, wise guy.

328
00:20:02,234 --> 00:20:04,759
Aw, that's it.
You just can't insult this guy.

329
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:07,839
You call him a moron, and he just
sits there grinning moronally.

330
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:10,909
- Hi, neighbor.
- You know what your problem is, Flanders?

331
00:20:11,009 --> 00:20:14,672
- You're afraid to be human.
- Oh, now, why would I be afraid of that?

332
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:18,238
Because humans are obnoxious sometimes,
humans hate things.

333
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:21,683
Well, maybe a few of them do...
back east.

334
00:20:21,787 --> 00:20:24,654
I can't find what Homer's saying.
Did you write that?

335
00:20:24,756 --> 00:20:26,656
Um, did you like it?

336
00:20:26,758 --> 00:20:29,625
Come on, Flanders.
There's got to be something you hate.

337
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:33,687
- What about mosquito bites?
- Mm-mmm. Sure are fun to scratch.

338
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:39,328
- Mmm, satisfying.
- What about, uh, fluorescent lights?

339
00:20:39,438 --> 00:20:41,770
Ooh, they hum like angels.

340
00:20:41,873 --> 00:20:44,273
You're never lonely
if you got a fluorescent light.

341
00:20:44,376 --> 00:20:46,276
See? You like everything!

342
00:20:46,378 --> 00:20:49,040
N-No, that's not true.
l-l-l-

343
00:20:49,147 --> 00:20:51,513
I don't like the service
at the post office.

344
00:20:51,617 --> 00:20:55,519
You know, it's all rush, rush,
get you in, get you out.

345
00:20:55,621 --> 00:20:58,954
Then they've got those machines in
the lobby. They're faster. No help there.

346
00:20:59,057 --> 00:21:02,891
You might even say...
I hate the post office.

347
00:21:02,995 --> 00:21:06,829
That and my parents.
Lousy beatniks.

348
00:21:08,033 --> 00:21:09,933
Hey, that felt good.

349
00:21:10,035 --> 00:21:12,299
He just said
he hates his parents.

350
00:21:12,404 --> 00:21:15,635
- Do you know what that means?
- Um, what do you think?

351
00:21:15,741 --> 00:21:18,266
- It means he's cured.
- That's what I said.

352
00:21:18,377 --> 00:21:21,505
<i>- [Woman] There he is!</i>
<i>- [People Cheering]</i>

353
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:27,646
Thanks, everyone.
I'm all better now.

354
00:21:27,753 --> 00:21:30,620
No more storing up the anger
until I explode.

355
00:21:30,722 --> 00:21:34,522
If any of you does something I don't like,
you are gonna hear about it!

356
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:37,789
- All right!
- [All Cheering]

357
00:21:37,896 --> 00:21:40,729
Yes, that's very healthy,
Ned.

358
00:21:40,832 --> 00:21:44,324
And if you really tick me off,
I'm gonna run you down with my car.

359
00:21:44,436 --> 00:21:46,961
- Yeah, uh- Um-
- Oh! Oh!

360
00:21:49,775 --> 00:21:54,371
[Laughs]
Ned, you're so crazy.

361
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:41,826
- [Murmuring]
- Shh!
