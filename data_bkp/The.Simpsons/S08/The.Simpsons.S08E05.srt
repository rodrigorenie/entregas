I know it's frustrating...

169
00:09:55,995 --> 00:09:58,930
but we made a commitment,
and we have to see it through...

170
00:09:59,031 --> 00:10:01,329
no matter how unpleasant.

171
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:05,928
Quitting time. Okay.
Scrub up and head for the communal tarp.

We're having kelp burgers, and we're going
to watch a tape ofJohnny Arvik.

Oh, that was our emcee,
Mel Zetz.

00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:25,251
He got out of bed too fast
and broke his hip.

the crowd tonight?

- Eep.

Oh, I agree.
Kids need rules and boundaries.

202

Yes, everyone loves rules.

203
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:55,173
It's so tough to be a parent these days,
what with all the gangs and the drugs.

Oh, yeah, drugs.
You gotta have drugs.

- Hello, Principal Skinner.

This is the National Air

214

Uh, this isn't gonna
be aboutJesus, is it?

215

All things are aboutJesus,
Homer, except this.

216
00:12:32,651 --> 00:12:35,984
Your son has been working
in a burlesque house.

217
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:38,556
Principal Skinner saw him
with his own eyes.

218
00:12:38,657 --> 00:12:42,388
That's true, but I was only in there to get
directions on how to get away from there.

219
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:46,454
Helen, as a responsible parent,
I was already well aware of that.

220
00:12:46,565 --> 00:12:48,863
Homer, I'm as permissive
as the next parent.

221
00:12:48,968 --> 00:12:53,530
I mean, just yesterday, I let Todd buy some
Red Hots with a cartoon devil on the box...

222
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:55,903
but you can't possibly
think it's appropriate...

223
00:12:56,008 --> 00:12:59,444
for your 10-year-old son
to work in a burlesque house!

224
00:12:59,545 --> 00:13:04,414
Oh, no? Well, if Homer Simpson wants his
10-year-old son working in a burlesque house...

225
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:08,385
then Homer Simpson's 10-year-old son
is going to work in a burlesque house!

226
00:13:08,487 --> 00:13:12,583
That's the-
[Laughs] Hi!

227
00:13:12,691 --> 00:13:18,095
Now, Marge, you're gonna hear a lot of crazy
talk about Bart working in a burlesque house.

228
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:23,435
"Maison Derriere"?

229
00:13:23,536 --> 00:13:28,235
I can't believe there's a place like that
in our wholesome little town.

230
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:32,208
Homer, did you know it was a burlesque house
when you sent Bart to work there?

231
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:34,211
No, I only learned that
four days ago.

232
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:37,942
What were you thinking,
sending Bart to such an awful place?

233
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:42,487
I was trying to punish
him exactly like you would.

234
00:13:42,588 --> 00:13:46,115
So, in a way, you really
dropped the ball on this one.

235
00:13:46,225 --> 00:13:49,683
This is your mess, and I'll be damned
if I'm gonna clean it up.

238
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:59,562
I have a favor to ask.

239
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:02,232
Please shut this place down
and move away from Springfield.

240
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:04,571
Oh, honey,
you can't be serious.

241
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:06,804
Springfield doesn't want
places like this.

242
00:14:06,912 --> 00:14:09,710
- I think I know what Springfield wants, sugar.
- Oh?

243
00:14:09,815 --> 00:14:14,946

- I've lived here 52 years.

- Sixth.

246
00:14:19,491 --> 00:14:22,517
Listen, darlin', we're just as much
a part of Springfield...

247
00:14:22,628 --> 00:14:25,791
as the church,
the library or the crazy house.

248
00:14:25,898 --> 00:14:30,426
- So I think I'll stay right here, neighbor.
- Is that so?

249
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:33,972
Well, sleazy entertainment
and raunchy jokes...

250
00:14:34,073 --> 00:14:37,770
will never be as popular
as sobriety and self-denial.

251
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:41,278
You're about to learn
the two most dangerous words...

252
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:44,611
in the English language
are "Marge Simpson."

253
00:14:46,318 --> 00:14:48,286

- No.

[All Clamoring]

331
00:20:41,106 --> 00:20:43,597
What are you doing, Marge?
Didn't you hear the song?

332
00:20:43,709 --> 00:20:45,768
No, I had to go
rent the bulldozer.

333
00:20:45,877 --> 00:20:47,777
Well, we all
changed our minds.

334
00:20:47,879 --> 00:20:49,779
Yeah, now we
love the house.

335
00:20:49,881 --> 00:20:52,406
And what about the sleaze
and the depravity?

336
00:20:52,517 --> 00:20:54,485
It was a very
convincing song, Marge.

337
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:58,454
- Mm-hmm, there were kicks and everything.
- Oh. Can you sing it again?

338
00:20:58,557 --> 00:21:02,118
I'm sorry. It really was one of those
spur-of-the-moment-type things.

339
00:21:02,227 --> 00:21:05,958
- Well, I also have a song to sing.

340
00:21:06,064 --> 00:21:08,726
Don't make up your mind
until you hear both songs.

341
00:21:08,834 --> 00:21:12,201
[Clears Throat, Coughs]

342

<i>[Crash]</i>

344
00:21:18,243 --> 00:21:20,643
Uh, sorry.

345
00:21:20,746 --> 00:21:25,615
Thanks a lot, Marge.
That was our only burlesque house.

346
00:21:25,717 --> 00:21:28,311
I do love it when
you drop by, Marge.

347
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:31,150
Next time, why don't we
get together at your house?

348
00:21:31,256 --> 00:21:33,156
I'm so sorry.

349
00:21:33,258 --> 00:21:35,453
How can we ever
make this up to you?

350
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,585
Oh, there's a way, Mom.

351
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:43,867
So, Twiggy, I hear you and your
husband, Woody, just had a baby.

352
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:45,869
What did you name him?

353
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:47,939
- Chip.

354
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,008
Take it off!

355
00:21:50,108 --> 00:21:52,702
- All right, Dad. You've been warned. Let's go.
- Hey!

356
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:54,176
- Come on.
- Easy.
