1
00:01:36,858 --> 00:01:38,444
All right, everybody. Listen up.

2
00:01:38,653 --> 00:01:43,203
Tuco Salamanca. For those of you
who were not with us this morning...

3
00:01:43,412 --> 00:01:45,581
...we raided his headquarters.

4
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:47,627
Also his last-known address.

5
00:01:47,836 --> 00:01:51,927
Even the little den of iniquity
he keeps for his meth-hag girlfriend.

6
00:01:52,136 --> 00:01:55,724
We netted a bunch of his lieutenants.
The man himself smelled us coming.

7
00:01:56,183 --> 00:02:00,567
So study the face. Study the file.

8
00:02:00,775 --> 00:02:03,156
Get a big old raging hard-on...

9
00:02:03,363 --> 00:02:06,659
...at the idea
of catching this piece of shit.

10
00:02:07,537 --> 00:02:09,583
My apologies
to the H.R. department.

11
00:02:09,791 --> 00:02:13,631
Grow tumescent with anticipation.

12
00:02:13,839 --> 00:02:15,383
All right.

13
00:02:15,592 --> 00:02:17,514
On the hit parade, 1998.

14
00:02:17,723 --> 00:02:19,684
Reputed to have whacked
one "Dog" Paulson...

15
00:02:19,892 --> 00:02:22,770
...back when our bandidos
were wresting the crank trade away...

16
00:02:22,979 --> 00:02:24,523
...from the SoCal biker gangs.

17
00:02:24,732 --> 00:02:28,156
Also, we're pretty sure
he knifed a Mexican national in '03.

18
00:02:28,365 --> 00:02:31,993
And for my money, seeing
how he customarily deals with rivals...

19
00:02:32,203 --> 00:02:34,832
...I'd say he is a prime suspect
in the disappearance...

20
00:02:35,042 --> 00:02:37,296
...of our dearly missed Krazy-8.

21
00:02:38,255 --> 00:02:40,469
Hats over your heart for that dirtball.

22
00:02:40,677 --> 00:02:42,679
We hauled Tuco in
for questioning on that...

23
00:02:42,888 --> 00:02:44,390
...but we couldn't make it stick.

24
00:02:44,603 --> 00:02:47,189
Yeah, he runs a tight ship.
Smug bastard.

25
00:02:48,149 --> 00:02:51,321
And even worse, EI Paso says he's
got some kind of cartel connection.

26
00:02:52,072 --> 00:02:54,744
Yeah, yeah. I know. We all know
what's going on down there.

27
00:02:54,954 --> 00:02:56,748
We sure don't want it going on
up here...

28
00:02:56,957 --> 00:02:58,750
...which brings us to the good news.

29
00:02:58,958 --> 00:03:03,468
We finally got some actual,
honest-to-God evidence.

30
00:03:04,136 --> 00:03:07,559
This is one of Tuco's henchmen.
Street name: No-Doze.

31
00:03:07,767 --> 00:03:11,271
Found him tucked in the junkyard
along with Tuco's own brother-in-law...

32
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:13,110
...a.k.a. Gonzo.

33
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:17,783
Gonzo, this rocket scientist,
was moving No-Doze's body-

34
00:03:17,993 --> 00:03:20,370
Either hiding it there
or pulling it out. Not sure.

35
00:03:20,579 --> 00:03:24,045
when he got his arm crushed
clean off.

36
00:03:24,255 --> 00:03:27,300
Anyone wanna see the photos,
they're on my website. Hilarious.

37
00:03:27,507 --> 00:03:29,471
Anyway. The upshot is...

38
00:03:29,681 --> 00:03:35,022
...we got us a nice, big, juicy,
bloody fingerprint...

39
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:38,655
...which belongs to Señor Tuco.

40
00:03:39,031 --> 00:03:42,451
Christmas came early
to the Schrader household.

41
00:03:42,659 --> 00:03:46,124
That is, provided we find this guy.

42
00:03:46,833 --> 00:03:49,633
So to all present, I ask you,
you wanna find this guy?

43
00:03:49,841 --> 00:03:52,343
Yes.
-Yes.

44
00:03:52,551 --> 00:03:53,970
What the hell was that? Jesus.

45
00:03:54,971 --> 00:03:56,685
Wanna try that again?

46
00:03:56,894 --> 00:04:00,106
Do you wanna find this guy?
-Yes!

47
00:04:00,316 --> 00:04:02,861
Are we going to find this guy?
-Yes!

48
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:04,364
Louder, damn it!
-Yes!

49
00:04:04,572 --> 00:04:06,493
Give me a "hell, yeah!"
-Hell, yeah!

50
00:04:06,701 --> 00:04:08,412
Hell, yeah!
-Hell, yeah!

51
00:04:08,621 --> 00:04:12,128
<i>Hell, yeah. Hell, yeah, Hell, yeah.</i>

52
00:04:16,762 --> 00:04:18,223
They ain't gonna find him.

53
00:04:18,431 --> 00:04:20,642
<i>Guy is in México by now.</i>

54
00:04:20,851 --> 00:04:23,858
Appearances, Gomey.
It's all about appearances.

55
00:04:26,611 --> 00:04:28,405
Listen, I gotta take
some personal time.

56
00:04:28,614 --> 00:04:30,325
Now, in the middle of a manhunt?

57
00:04:31,619 --> 00:04:35,084
Skyler called last night.
It's Walt. He's missing.

58
00:04:35,293 --> 00:04:38,423
Just disappeared from the house,
and no one's heard from him since.

59
00:04:38,631 --> 00:04:41,594
Damn. You don't think he...?

60
00:04:43,726 --> 00:04:45,186
Holler if you need me.

61
00:04:45,395 --> 00:04:48,273
All right. Thanks a lot, man.
Appreciate that.

62
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:04,574
This is the most recent photo.
We haven't taken many lately, so...

63
00:06:05,825 --> 00:06:08,914
But that's what he looks like now.

64
00:06:09,372 --> 00:06:11,459
Without the hair.

65
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:15,383
Hey, it's me.

66
00:06:15,967 --> 00:06:19,097
Hey, Tim. Really appreciate you
sparing us your day off.

67
00:06:19,306 --> 00:06:21,729
No worries. Happy to help.

68
00:06:21,937 --> 00:06:24,190
Yeah, this is helpful. Good.

69
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:26,778
What about height and weight?
-Five eleven...

70
00:06:26,986 --> 00:06:29,114
...most recently, about 170.

71
00:06:29,657 --> 00:06:33,750
One sixty-five. That's what I weigh.

72
00:06:33,958 --> 00:06:36,794
I guess he weighs a little less.

73
00:06:37,002 --> 00:06:40,261
That's fine.
That's close enough. Good.

74
00:06:40,469 --> 00:06:42,806
What about
other distinguishing features?

75
00:06:43,014 --> 00:06:45,310
Tattoos or moles or scars?

76
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:50,569
Anything that might help us.
-Tattoos? No. Not really. No.

77
00:06:51,195 --> 00:06:52,573
That's fine.

78
00:06:52,781 --> 00:06:54,617
Is that the list of medications?
-Yes.

79
00:06:54,826 --> 00:06:57,330
I wrote them all down.
And there's no drug interactions.

80
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:01,254
None that are listed.
I called his doctor, so, no.

81
00:07:02,546 --> 00:07:03,965
Has he been depressed?

82
00:07:08,558 --> 00:07:13,942
He's been withdrawn lately.
A little withdrawn.

83
00:07:14,692 --> 00:07:15,864
Yeah.

84
00:07:16,907 --> 00:07:20,370
Last night, he was agitated.

85
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:21,707
Agitated?

86
00:07:21,915 --> 00:07:26,383
Yeah. When he came home last night,
he was agitated, upset.

87
00:07:26,591 --> 00:07:30,305
Upset in general? Or upset
because of something particular?

88
00:07:33,938 --> 00:07:39,071
When I asked him what was wrong,
he said:

89
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,823
"I don't know where to begin."

90
00:07:43,203 --> 00:07:45,916
Then he just walked out of the room-
Out of the bathroom.

91
00:07:46,123 --> 00:07:47,752
I was in the tub, taking a bath.

92
00:07:47,961 --> 00:07:51,006
and when I came out
about 10 minutes later, he was gone.

93
00:07:52,009 --> 00:07:53,805
Nothing else missing?

94
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:59,021
His keys, wallet, cell phone.
Just what was on him.

95
00:07:59,563 --> 00:08:02,903
But-What about the phone call?

96
00:08:05,409 --> 00:08:06,451
I'm looking into it.

97
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:10,584
What phone call?
-Walt's cell phone rang.

98
00:08:10,793 --> 00:08:15,133
He pulled it out, looked at it,
and didn't answer it.

99
00:08:15,341 --> 00:08:18,974
But then, a short time after,
he wandered out of the bathroom.

100
00:08:19,181 --> 00:08:20,977
I mean...

101
00:08:21,185 --> 00:08:23,021
...couldn't that be...

102
00:08:23,229 --> 00:08:25,106
...important, right?

103
00:08:28,948 --> 00:08:30,743
Anything else you can think of?

104
00:08:31,744 --> 00:08:33,497
Anything else.

105
00:08:33,706 --> 00:08:35,833
No. I called
the credit card providers...

106
00:08:36,042 --> 00:08:41,178
...and there's no report
of any recent activity.

107
00:08:41,386 --> 00:08:45,727
I-Let's see. I checked
with every hospital within 50 miles.

108
00:08:45,936 --> 00:08:48,023
Every police station. Every morgue.

109
00:08:48,231 --> 00:08:50,902
So, no, I really don't-
I don't have anything else.

110
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:54,619
I was actually hoping
that you had something else...

111
00:08:54,827 --> 00:08:57,331
...being that you're the expert.

112
00:09:01,671 --> 00:09:03,172
I'm sorry.

113
00:09:03,385 --> 00:09:04,719
No worries.

114
00:09:04,928 --> 00:09:08,683
I think this is good enough to start.
Gives us plenty to work on.

115
00:09:10,645 --> 00:09:13,400
Mrs. White.
-Thank you.

116
00:09:13,609 --> 00:09:16,031
Walter.
-Thank you.

117
00:09:26,004 --> 00:09:29,094
So that cell-phone call
she's talking about? I ran it.

118
00:09:29,302 --> 00:09:31,224
And?
-Never happened.

119
00:09:31,433 --> 00:09:32,893
No record of it.

120
00:09:33,102 --> 00:09:35,398
Second cell phone.
-Yeah. I'm thinking.

121
00:11:14,443 --> 00:11:16,989
I understand.

122
00:11:19,245 --> 00:11:20,790
Out.

123
00:11:21,831 --> 00:11:22,959
Get away from me!

124
00:11:25,754 --> 00:11:28,134
Settle down, bitch.

125
00:11:28,343 --> 00:11:32,641
You gonna shoot me, huh?
Shoot me in here!

126
00:11:32,849 --> 00:11:35,144
I hope I bleed like a mother too!

127
00:11:35,354 --> 00:11:37,401
That way, you have to clean it up!

128
00:11:41,447 --> 00:11:42,784
It's your ride, retard.

129
00:11:42,992 --> 00:11:44,912
I ain't gotta clean jack. Now, get out.

130
00:11:55,307 --> 00:11:57,144
Get up.

131
00:11:57,895 --> 00:11:59,689
Get up.

132
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:10,416
Oh, my God.

133
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:12,710
Don't do this, Tuco.

134
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:39,528
No more posters?

135
00:13:40,238 --> 00:13:42,824
Walter Jr.'s making more.

136
00:13:46,584 --> 00:13:48,543
Thank you, Marie.

137
00:13:52,427 --> 00:13:55,139
I don't think he'll hurt himself.

138
00:13:55,348 --> 00:13:58,894
I mean, he just doesn't strike me
as the type.

139
00:13:59,103 --> 00:14:00,730
He'll turn up.

140
00:14:10,709 --> 00:14:13,088
Okay, the whole tiara thing...

141
00:14:13,297 --> 00:14:16,842
...I just find it bewildering that...
-Marie.

142
00:14:17,051 --> 00:14:19,934
...you didn't believe that-
-Marie.

143
00:14:21,979 --> 00:14:23,604
Not now.

144
00:15:56,932 --> 00:15:58,602
Empty your pockets.

145
00:16:27,489 --> 00:16:29,824
Thought your name was
Heisenberg...

146
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,828
..."Walter Hartwell White."

147
00:16:33,038 --> 00:16:36,252
Heisenberg is kind of a pseudonym.

148
00:16:37,588 --> 00:16:41,010
You know, a business name.

149
00:16:47,564 --> 00:16:49,651
Yeah.

150
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:57,580
I like doing business
with a family man.

151
00:16:58,039 --> 00:17:00,378
There's always a lot of collateral.

152
00:17:35,604 --> 00:17:38,152
Answer me one thing.

153
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:42,824
Can I trust you?

154
00:17:43,827 --> 00:17:47,291
Yes. Yes, absolutely.

155
00:17:57,142 --> 00:17:59,062
Sit down.

156
00:18:07,868 --> 00:18:09,705
DEA...

157
00:18:11,708 --> 00:18:14,172
...hit my place of business
this morning.

158
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:16,592
About a hundred cops
looking for me.

159
00:18:18,137 --> 00:18:21,308
You two haven't been talking, right?
-No.

160
00:18:21,518 --> 00:18:22,938
No.

161
00:18:24,898 --> 00:18:28,028
Picked up my whole crew,
top to bottom.

162
00:18:28,405 --> 00:18:31,283
Everybody except Gonzo.

163
00:18:31,491 --> 00:18:33,540
That's weird, right?

164
00:18:33,749 --> 00:18:37,212
I mean, don't you think
that that's weird?

165
00:18:37,421 --> 00:18:40,133
It's weird. Yes.

166
00:18:40,341 --> 00:18:41,720
Unusual.

167
00:18:42,515 --> 00:18:44,310
Unusual.

168
00:18:45,226 --> 00:18:50,236
Last two days,
I couldn't get Gonzo on the phone.

169
00:18:51,529 --> 00:18:54,743
He's been acting all pouty
on account of No-Doze.

170
00:18:56,452 --> 00:18:58,455
Explain to me.

171
00:18:58,959 --> 00:19:03,758
How is it my fault that that little
bitch did not know his place?

172
00:19:10,645 --> 00:19:12,606
I saw this coming.

173
00:19:13,983 --> 00:19:16,404
I can see the future, you know?

174
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:21,287
It's this gift that I have
deep inside my head.

175
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:25,923
I knew last night they were gonna
come try and bust me.

176
00:19:26,631 --> 00:19:27,633
Gonzo.

177
00:19:30,012 --> 00:19:35,230
He went and snitched to the cops!
That lousy son of a bitch!

178
00:19:35,981 --> 00:19:42,157
I trusted him like a brother!
I was good to him! I was good!

179
00:19:42,365 --> 00:19:45,956
I see Gonzo, I'm gonna gut him,
I'm gonna skin him...

180
00:19:46,165 --> 00:19:49,671
...and I'm gonna stuff his hide
for a heavy bag...

181
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:54,012
...and every time I hit him,
it's gonna be like a lesson to myself!

182
00:19:54,221 --> 00:19:58,269
You never,
never trust the people that you love!

183
00:20:04,572 --> 00:20:10,499
So you plan to ice Gonzo,
like, future tense?

184
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:12,628
What?

185
00:20:13,671 --> 00:20:15,967
You're saying, Tuco...

186
00:20:16,175 --> 00:20:18,971
You're saying that Gonzo...

187
00:20:19,179 --> 00:20:23,480
...is currently operating
as a police informant...

188
00:20:23,687 --> 00:20:24,898
...as far as you know?

189
00:20:28,109 --> 00:20:30,575
I'm very sorry to hear that.

190
00:20:31,785 --> 00:20:33,621
That's disappointing.

191
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,249
Yeah.

192
00:20:35,457 --> 00:20:38,422
I'd waste him too, yo.
-Shut up.

193
00:20:38,632 --> 00:20:40,007
Okay.

194
00:20:40,466 --> 00:20:43,097
They're out there looking for me
right now.

195
00:20:43,304 --> 00:20:46,101
They got ghetto birds
and black ops.

196
00:20:46,308 --> 00:20:50,443
I need to get high.
I need to get good and high.

197
00:20:55,995 --> 00:20:58,416
What's with this gak?
It smells like headcheese.

198
00:20:59,209 --> 00:21:02,672
No, it's-It's killer.

199
00:21:03,088 --> 00:21:04,425
Yeah, seriously.

200
00:21:07,849 --> 00:21:11,980
So I was thinking last night.

201
00:21:12,188 --> 00:21:13,815
I came up with this great idea.

202
00:21:18,116 --> 00:21:22,748
Mexico?
-We'll disappear way out in the jungle.

203
00:21:22,956 --> 00:21:24,712
We'll set you up in a superlab.

204
00:21:24,922 --> 00:21:27,424
We'll do nothing but cook 24/7.

205
00:21:27,633 --> 00:21:29,510
And no Federales
are gonna mess with us...

206
00:21:29,719 --> 00:21:31,932
...because I got my people there.

207
00:21:32,142 --> 00:21:33,936
Connections.

208
00:21:34,603 --> 00:21:38,360
We're going to make beaucoup bucks,
Heisenberg, huh?

209
00:21:38,568 --> 00:21:40,654
Tuco, I...

210
00:21:41,158 --> 00:21:43,494
I have a wife and family.

211
00:21:44,746 --> 00:21:46,874
So what? You'll get another one.

212
00:21:47,083 --> 00:21:51,131
I don't want you to take
this the wrong way, but I can't just...

213
00:21:51,341 --> 00:21:53,721
...uproot my life like that.

214
00:21:53,929 --> 00:21:55,888
Yeah, man. I mean, me neither.

215
00:21:58,936 --> 00:22:00,648
Who's talking to you?

216
00:22:04,154 --> 00:22:07,033
You need me, man...

217
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:10,415
...because I cooked that scante
in your hands.

218
00:22:13,003 --> 00:22:14,755
Yeah.

219
00:22:14,964 --> 00:22:16,549
I'll tell you something, yo.

220
00:22:16,757 --> 00:22:19,598
You never tried nothing like it.

221
00:22:19,806 --> 00:22:21,934
Stink or no stink...

222
00:22:22,143 --> 00:22:26,611
...one bump,
you'll be flying high for days.

223
00:22:28,613 --> 00:22:32,286
It's a new product him
and I've been working up.

224
00:22:32,494 --> 00:22:34,830
Careful when you hit it.

225
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:37,879
It kicks like a 12 gauge
when it comes on.

226
00:22:41,134 --> 00:22:43,471
It's got a secret ingredient.

227
00:22:45,769 --> 00:22:47,270
What secret ingredient?

228
00:22:48,397 --> 00:22:50,275
Chilli powder.

229
00:22:57,537 --> 00:22:58,916
I hate chilli powder.

230
00:23:02,966 --> 00:23:05,970
This blue magic, this is money.

231
00:23:07,682 --> 00:23:10,268
You keep cooking this, Heisenberg.

232
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:17,699
We're gonna rewrite history
with this.

233
00:23:21,832 --> 00:23:25,878
All right. Time to clean the menudo
out from between your ears.

234
00:23:26,547 --> 00:23:30,013
No, no, no. No, I need him, Tuco.

235
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:32,223
I need him very, very badly.

236
00:23:34,686 --> 00:23:35,730
He's my partner.

237
00:23:37,064 --> 00:23:41,031
And if he doesn't go, I don't go.

238
00:23:43,242 --> 00:23:46,415
I'll tell you this. My cousins
are driving up here right now...

239
00:23:46,622 --> 00:23:49,420
...to smuggle us back,
and they're gonna be here by sunset...

240
00:23:49,628 --> 00:23:53,093
...and you're gonna be on that truck,
or you're gonna be dead!

241
00:23:55,096 --> 00:23:56,642
And you...

242
00:23:57,977 --> 00:24:00,857
You better hope they got room
in the trunk.

243
00:24:16,467 --> 00:24:20,474
Where are you going?
-Louis is taking me to the train station.

244
00:24:20,683 --> 00:24:22,435
We'll put these up.

245
00:24:22,643 --> 00:24:26,651
No, no, honey. No, I'll do it.
-He wants to help, let him help.

246
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:30,282
I mean, how long has it been
since you've slept?

247
00:24:31,242 --> 00:24:34,583
Yeah, she's right, Sky.
Why don't you lay down a while?

248
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:38,254
For chrissake,
you got a bun in the oven.

249
00:24:38,547 --> 00:24:40,758
I got my cell if you need me.

250
00:24:40,967 --> 00:24:43,055
Okay?
-Okay.

251
00:24:44,474 --> 00:24:48,147
Bye, sweetie. I'll see you later.
-All right. Bye.

252
00:24:50,862 --> 00:24:55,576
Actually, I think the very fact
they haven't found him yet...

253
00:24:55,783 --> 00:24:57,620
...bodes well.

254
00:24:58,746 --> 00:25:03,090
Well, I mean, if he-You know.

255
00:25:04,132 --> 00:25:07,179
Somebody would've
smelled something by now.

256
00:25:07,929 --> 00:25:09,976
There's got to be something.

257
00:25:10,185 --> 00:25:12,063
Some detail
that we haven't picked up on.

258
00:25:13,105 --> 00:25:16,653
What about the second cell phone?
-Jesus.

259
00:25:16,861 --> 00:25:20,495
What? We can't just ignore
a potential clue, Hank.

260
00:25:21,956 --> 00:25:24,001
Okay. What are you talking about?

261
00:25:28,385 --> 00:25:32,432
The call you said Walt got
before he disappeared?

262
00:25:32,641 --> 00:25:34,936
There's no record of it
with the phone company.

263
00:25:35,648 --> 00:25:37,900
No incoming,
no dropped calls, nothing.

264
00:25:38,109 --> 00:25:40,153
But his phone rang. I heard it.

265
00:25:41,365 --> 00:25:46,582
All right. Well, then if that's the case,
he must have a second phone.

266
00:25:48,837 --> 00:25:51,382
Why? What sense would there be
in that?

267
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:54,637
Yeah. All right. Okay.
I'm not here to argue with you.

268
00:25:57,185 --> 00:26:00,396
No, Hank. You can't just bring up
secret cell phone and then drop it.

269
00:26:00,604 --> 00:26:02,653
What does it mean?

270
00:26:02,862 --> 00:26:04,989
I don't know, Sky.
What do you want me to say?

271
00:26:06,533 --> 00:26:09,329
It means Walt has a secret.

272
00:26:09,537 --> 00:26:13,379
Everyone's got one from somebody,
big or little.

273
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:18,512
Okay. Everyone. Okay.
-Skyler, come on.

274
00:26:18,721 --> 00:26:22,646
He kept cancer from you for weeks.

275
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:28,487
Okay, then, let's assume
there's a second cell phone.

276
00:26:28,696 --> 00:26:31,117
So what?
What, is he having an affair?

277
00:26:31,785 --> 00:26:33,662
Walt? Please.

278
00:26:38,044 --> 00:26:43,680
What about the marijuana?
-He's not on pot anymore.

279
00:26:43,889 --> 00:26:45,892
Says who? Him?

280
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:48,231
Chemotherapy
and marijuana go together...

281
00:26:48,439 --> 00:26:52,362
...like apple pie and Chevrolet.

282
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:57,247
Maybe he's addicted to the pot...

283
00:26:57,456 --> 00:26:59,500
...and he owes his drug dealer
a lot of money.

284
00:26:59,708 --> 00:27:02,797
Marie, you don't get hooked on pot
like that.

285
00:27:03,005 --> 00:27:05,971
How do you know? You didn't even
know he had a second cell phone.

286
00:27:07,347 --> 00:27:10,936
Hank, you have to question
this drug-dealer person.

287
00:27:11,144 --> 00:27:12,730
He may know something.

288
00:27:18,158 --> 00:27:21,953
Well, I'm telling you,
we're grasping at straws here.

289
00:27:23,374 --> 00:27:25,962
Then grasp.

290
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:37,484
Excuse me, ma'am.

291
00:27:38,443 --> 00:27:41,572
Hi, I'm looking for Jesse.
He around?

292
00:27:42,409 --> 00:27:44,162
No. I'm afraid not.

293
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:47,290
Why?
-I'm sorry. Hank Schrader.

294
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:51,926
I'm actually hoping to talk to Jesse
about my brother-in-law, Walter White.

295
00:27:52,134 --> 00:27:55,347
He taught your son chemistry
in high school.

296
00:27:55,554 --> 00:27:58,894
Oh, Mr. White.
Yes, I remember him.

297
00:27:59,102 --> 00:28:01,733
That was a long time ago.
-Yes, ma'am.

298
00:28:01,943 --> 00:28:05,614
It's my understanding that he
and Jesse, they've stayed in touch.

299
00:28:06,574 --> 00:28:08,743
Really?
-Yeah.

300
00:28:11,542 --> 00:28:14,336
Mr. White must've seen
some potential in Jesse.

301
00:28:14,546 --> 00:28:16,884
He really tried to motivate him.

302
00:28:17,093 --> 00:28:19,472
He was one of the few teachers
who cared.

303
00:28:19,681 --> 00:28:21,475
Yeah, Walt's that way.
He's a good man.

304
00:28:22,268 --> 00:28:24,230
I'm so sorry
to hear about his illness.

305
00:28:24,438 --> 00:28:26,066
Please pass along our best wishes.

306
00:28:26,274 --> 00:28:29,614
I certainly will,
as soon as he turns up.

307
00:28:29,823 --> 00:28:31,033
He's missing, actually.

308
00:28:31,994 --> 00:28:33,496
Just kind of walked off, or...

309
00:28:34,873 --> 00:28:37,002
Anyway, which is why
I'm going around...

310
00:28:37,211 --> 00:28:39,841
...trying to think of anyone
who knows him, even slightly.

311
00:28:40,049 --> 00:28:41,759
That's terrible.

312
00:28:41,969 --> 00:28:44,264
Anything we can do to help.

313
00:28:44,472 --> 00:28:47,437
Well, if you could put me in touch
with your son...

314
00:28:47,645 --> 00:28:50,693
Like I said,
we're kind of desperate for leads.

315
00:28:50,902 --> 00:28:54,950
Jesse's not answering either number,
and no one seems to be at his house.

316
00:28:55,159 --> 00:28:59,290
And why do you think my son
and Mr. White would be in touch?

317
00:29:00,543 --> 00:29:03,466
I don't necessarily. I just-

318
00:29:03,674 --> 00:29:05,886
Are you with the police?
-No, ma'am. Not at all.

319
00:29:09,016 --> 00:29:13,274
I'm with
the Drug Enforcement Administration.

320
00:29:13,691 --> 00:29:15,027
Oh, my God.

321
00:29:15,236 --> 00:29:16,320
Is my son in trouble?

322
00:29:16,528 --> 00:29:18,991
I have absolutely no reason
to think that, no.

323
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,706
Do I need to get a lawyer?

324
00:29:21,914 --> 00:29:24,502
You know, you don't seem
very forthright about this...

325
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:27,129
...coming here and asking questions
about my son and-

326
00:29:27,339 --> 00:29:29,758
Mrs. Pinkman,
I'm not here on official capacity.

327
00:29:29,967 --> 00:29:33,643
I do not care what your son may
or may not have done wrong.

328
00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:35,601
I just wanna find my brother-in-law.

329
00:29:36,688 --> 00:29:40,862
His wife is worried sick,
and she's got a baby on the way.

330
00:29:42,282 --> 00:29:44,911
I'm sorry. I would like to help you...

331
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,622
...but I have not seen my son
in over a month.

332
00:29:47,831 --> 00:29:51,214
I don't expect to see him
anytime soon.

333
00:29:52,551 --> 00:29:56,139
Well, thanks for your time.

334
00:30:00,272 --> 00:30:02,399
If you could tell me one more thing.

335
00:30:02,608 --> 00:30:06,993
Is Jesse still driving the '89 Chevy
Monte Carlo, as far as you know?

336
00:30:07,869 --> 00:30:12,627
If he had spent half as much time
and money on his education...

337
00:30:12,835 --> 00:30:17,052
...as he has
on that ridiculous bouncing car...

338
00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:20,431
Low rider, huh?

339
00:30:21,809 --> 00:30:23,227
Gomey, hey.

340
00:30:23,435 --> 00:30:26,277
No, nothing yet. Hey, listen,
do me a solid and check out...

341
00:30:26,485 --> 00:30:28,571
...a '89 Chevy Monte Carlo...

342
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:33,206
...registered to a one
Jesse Pinkman.

343
00:30:33,414 --> 00:30:36,543
Specifically, I wanna know
if the car's got a LoJack.

344
00:30:36,752 --> 00:30:40,299
It's one of those jack-off low riders,
so I'm betting there is.

345
00:30:40,508 --> 00:30:43,848
If so, can you go ahead
and get me a fix on it? Thanks, buddy.

346
00:31:10,811 --> 00:31:12,814
Chilli powder.

347
00:31:13,230 --> 00:31:16,862
Did I not already tell you
how moronic that was?

348
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:18,407
Whatever, man.

349
00:31:18,615 --> 00:31:20,370
At least I tried something.

350
00:31:20,578 --> 00:31:22,497
Hey, it almost worked too.

351
00:31:22,706 --> 00:31:25,793
How's about
you leaving my gun, huh?

352
00:31:26,003 --> 00:31:28,842
First you boost it,
then you leave it in your house.

353
00:31:29,051 --> 00:31:30,720
My gun.

354
00:31:31,971 --> 00:31:37,565
How was I supposed to know you were
chauffeuring Tuco to my doorstep?

355
00:31:37,775 --> 00:31:40,946
Well, at least he wants you alive.

356
00:32:15,507 --> 00:32:16,801
Hey, I don't get it.

357
00:32:17,009 --> 00:32:20,013
If Tuco didn't kill Gonzo,
then who did?

358
00:32:20,223 --> 00:32:21,936
I don't know.

359
00:32:22,603 --> 00:32:24,481
I don't know.

360
00:32:25,982 --> 00:32:27,777
Does it really matter?

361
00:32:27,986 --> 00:32:31,952
If he finds out that Gonzo is dead
and not a police informant...

362
00:32:32,161 --> 00:32:34,246
...who does he
automatically blame?

363
00:32:34,455 --> 00:32:36,292
Us.

364
00:32:39,046 --> 00:32:40,675
We need a plan.

365
00:32:42,888 --> 00:32:46,184
Think, think.
-Let's just bum-rush him, man.

366
00:32:46,391 --> 00:32:48,648
You crack him over
the head with something...

367
00:32:48,857 --> 00:32:50,901
...and I'll go for his gun.

368
00:32:55,492 --> 00:32:58,498
Crack him over the head
with something?

369
00:33:01,669 --> 00:33:04,382
Hey, you got the C-bomb, man,
all right?

370
00:33:04,591 --> 00:33:06,259
You're as good
as checked out already.

371
00:33:06,468 --> 00:33:10,560
Okay? You should be, like, all
sacrificial, jumping on a grenade, yo.

372
00:33:10,769 --> 00:33:12,187
Just...

373
00:33:14,609 --> 00:33:17,322
Oh, so my life
is not the priority here...

374
00:33:17,531 --> 00:33:20,076
...because I'm gonna be
dead soon anyway.

375
00:33:20,284 --> 00:33:22,080
That's your point?

376
00:33:22,747 --> 00:33:24,290
Yeah.

377
00:33:52,009 --> 00:33:55,012
We gotta get him to take this.

378
00:33:55,221 --> 00:33:57,599
Well, he don't much like
the taste of chilli P.

379
00:33:57,807 --> 00:33:59,643
That much has been established.

380
00:33:59,852 --> 00:34:02,818
So unless you can convince him
to booty bump...

381
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:11,791
Eat. We got a long ride ahead of us.

382
00:34:29,990 --> 00:34:32,619
Go on, sit. You're looking
a little weak, Heisenberg.

383
00:34:32,828 --> 00:34:36,083
I don't want you to go belly up
before we get there.

384
00:35:15,652 --> 00:35:17,448
<i>Take it easy, Tio.</i>

385
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:21,955
I will feed you.
I eat first. That's the deal.

386
00:35:29,968 --> 00:35:31,639
What?

387
00:35:39,399 --> 00:35:41,322
I get it, I get it, I get it.

388
00:35:41,531 --> 00:35:45,745
Oh, you greedy old bastard.

389
00:35:45,954 --> 00:35:48,164
I tell you, Heisenberg.

390
00:35:50,045 --> 00:35:51,339
Old people.

391
00:35:52,509 --> 00:35:54,175
You feed them, huh?

392
00:35:54,384 --> 00:35:57,015
You put them in a really nice crib
in the country...

393
00:35:57,223 --> 00:36:00,604
...and yet they gotta steal
the food off your plate.

394
00:36:01,064 --> 00:36:04,069
You better eat every bite of that.

395
00:36:27,568 --> 00:36:30,073
What did you do that for?

396
00:36:30,281 --> 00:36:32,200
God!

397
00:37:16,528 --> 00:37:18,824
Hey, look. Look.

398
00:37:19,032 --> 00:37:20,661
There's nothing left.

399
00:37:47,124 --> 00:37:50,754
What? What do you want?

400
00:37:56,974 --> 00:37:58,434
No.

401
00:37:58,644 --> 00:38:01,899
Don't even tell me
that you're hungry.

402
00:38:02,107 --> 00:38:03,359
Don't go there.

403
00:38:16,716 --> 00:38:18,678
<i>Are you mad-dogging them, Tio?</i>

404
00:38:20,806 --> 00:38:23,604
What, you don't like them?

405
00:38:25,899 --> 00:38:26,942
One ding.

406
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:30,529
<i>That means yes. Tio don't like you.</i>

407
00:38:34,999 --> 00:38:37,626
<i>Why don't you like them, Tio?</i>

408
00:38:40,883 --> 00:38:42,969
You don't trust them?

409
00:38:49,734 --> 00:38:54,991
<i>-Why don't you trust them, Tio?
-Tuco, come on. He's...</i>

410
00:38:55,491 --> 00:38:59,165
There clearly some dementia.
He's not lucid.

411
00:39:12,564 --> 00:39:14,358
<i>Did they do something to you, Tio?</i>

412
00:39:18,157 --> 00:39:19,826
Something that you don't like?

413
00:39:26,923 --> 00:39:30,885
<i>What did they do to you?
What did you do to my tio?</i>

414
00:39:31,095 --> 00:39:32,388
Nothing. Nothing.

415
00:39:32,597 --> 00:39:37,399
<i>-Bullshit! My tio does not lie!
-I don't know. I swear. I don't know.</i>

416
00:39:37,607 --> 00:39:42,407
No, I-Maybe it was-I did change
the channel on his TV, but...

417
00:39:42,615 --> 00:39:44,870
Yeah, that's it.
While you were cooking...

418
00:39:45,079 --> 00:39:48,584
...he was watching
one of those telenovels...

419
00:39:48,792 --> 00:39:51,422
...with all those ripe honeys on it.
He was really into it.

420
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:53,300
I told you
not to change the channel.

421
00:39:53,509 --> 00:39:56,515
You know, dude needs his eye candy.
That's it.

422
00:40:04,027 --> 00:40:06,155
<i>Is that it, Tio?</i>

423
00:40:06,657 --> 00:40:08,784
<i>Is that it, Tio?</i>

424
00:40:10,498 --> 00:40:11,916
Did they change your mamitas?

425
00:40:21,099 --> 00:40:23,228
<i>What are you telling me, Tio?</i>

426
00:40:26,023 --> 00:40:27,317
Are they punking me?

427
00:40:42,677 --> 00:40:45,139
Hey. No.

428
00:40:45,348 --> 00:40:48,773
No, man. No.

429
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:50,441
Come here!
-No.

430
00:40:50,650 --> 00:40:54,197
No, no, Tuco.

431
00:41:01,042 --> 00:41:04,046
Tuco, no. Tuco.

432
00:41:08,431 --> 00:41:10,226
Shut up!

433
00:41:22,289 --> 00:41:26,212
No. Please, no. God. Please, no.

434
00:41:26,421 --> 00:41:28,924
No, God. I don't wanna die.

435
00:41:29,133 --> 00:41:31,093
Tell me what you did, Walter!

436
00:41:31,302 --> 00:41:34,601
Jesus, I don't wanna die.

437
00:41:35,311 --> 00:41:38,566
No!
-Tell me what you did!

438
00:41:44,328 --> 00:41:46,663
We tried to poison you.

439
00:41:48,248 --> 00:41:50,379
We tried to poison you...

440
00:41:52,173 --> 00:41:56,305
...because you're an insane,
degenerate piece of filth...

441
00:41:56,513 --> 00:41:58,474
...and you deserve to die.

442
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:43,344
Who's the bitch now?

443
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:05,842
Let him bleed.

444
00:43:24,793 --> 00:43:26,462
The keys.

445
00:43:27,463 --> 00:43:29,050
Tuco.

446
00:43:29,843 --> 00:43:31,513
Oh, my God.

447
00:43:33,391 --> 00:43:34,977
The cousins?

448
00:44:31,950 --> 00:44:33,245
What the hell is going on?

449
00:44:45,055 --> 00:44:46,934
Jesse Pinkman.

450
00:44:47,686 --> 00:44:49,896
You're a hard man to find.

451
00:44:57,996 --> 00:45:00,333
Oh, shit.

452
00:45:11,686 --> 00:45:13,314
Easy.

453
00:46:30,197 --> 00:46:32,367
Oh, my God.

454
00:46:34,330 --> 00:46:37,500
Oh, God. Hank.

455
00:46:37,709 --> 00:46:39,129
Who?
-Hank.

456
00:46:39,338 --> 00:46:40,716
What?

457
00:46:40,924 --> 00:46:42,635
Oh, my God.
-What?

458
00:46:42,844 --> 00:46:46,016
Oh, my God.
-Stay. What are you doing?
