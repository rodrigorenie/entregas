1
00:02:26,327 --> 00:02:30,248
You're not thinking about
going to work today, are you?

2
00:02:30,873 --> 00:02:34,085
Thought I would. That inhaler really
seems to be doing the trick.

3
00:02:35,294 --> 00:02:37,338
What?
-Just take the rest of the week.

4
00:02:37,547 --> 00:02:40,258
Please. You've earned it.

5
00:02:40,466 --> 00:02:42,176
Don't push it.

6
00:02:42,385 --> 00:02:45,513
Besides, I want you well
for the weekend.

7
00:02:47,765 --> 00:02:50,268
Mom wants to party.

8
00:02:50,476 --> 00:02:54,147
It's just a little get-together,
that's all.

9
00:02:54,605 --> 00:02:56,691
Sunday afternoon, maybe?
Nothing too big.

10
00:02:56,899 --> 00:02:59,777
Just family and a few friends.

11
00:03:00,444 --> 00:03:03,239
We've got a lot to celebrate.
Don't you think?

12
00:03:06,284 --> 00:03:07,785
Sounds good.

13
00:03:19,672 --> 00:03:21,174
Oh, thank you.

14
00:03:21,382 --> 00:03:23,009
Now...

15
00:03:23,843 --> 00:03:26,095
...what are you supposed
to do today?

16
00:03:26,304 --> 00:03:29,640
Nothing.
-Excellent.

17
00:03:33,644 --> 00:03:36,105
Brownie points for taking a nap.

18
00:05:10,158 --> 00:05:11,742
Can you meet?

19
00:05:14,787 --> 00:05:19,041
I thought maybe you
might have, you know...

20
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:20,710
...kicked.

21
00:05:21,085 --> 00:05:23,254
Signed-Signed off.

22
00:05:23,462 --> 00:05:26,048
I was even checking the obits.

23
00:05:26,632 --> 00:05:28,259
No such luck.

24
00:05:29,218 --> 00:05:32,305
So where does it stand?

25
00:05:32,972 --> 00:05:36,767
Coughing up blood,
giving speeches, you know, like:

26
00:05:36,976 --> 00:05:39,854
"I deserve this. I'm an asshole."

27
00:05:40,062 --> 00:05:41,772
What's the upshot?

28
00:05:42,773 --> 00:05:44,108
The upshot.

29
00:05:46,903 --> 00:05:51,449
The upshot is that
I have radiation pneumonitis.

30
00:05:54,619 --> 00:05:55,620
Damn.

31
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:00,208
Actually, it's not
as bad as it sounds.

32
00:06:01,542 --> 00:06:05,796
It's a fairly common occurrence,
easily treated.

33
00:06:06,756 --> 00:06:08,633
In fact...

34
00:06:09,008 --> 00:06:11,803
...the news is all good.

35
00:06:12,762 --> 00:06:14,555
What do you mean, good?

36
00:06:15,515 --> 00:06:18,184
You mean, like, "good" good?

37
00:06:19,769 --> 00:06:21,479
What, you mean, like,
remission good?

38
00:06:23,064 --> 00:06:28,236
Remission. Not to imply I'm cured.
I still have cancer.

39
00:06:29,195 --> 00:06:31,656
But there's been a significant
reduction in the tumours.

40
00:06:32,532 --> 00:06:34,408
How significant?

41
00:06:35,034 --> 00:06:36,786
Eighty percent.

42
00:06:37,161 --> 00:06:39,163
Dude. No way.

43
00:06:39,372 --> 00:06:42,458
Now, I'm not out of the woods yet,
not by any stretch...

44
00:06:44,001 --> 00:06:47,672
...but "options" is the word
they keep bandying about.

45
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:50,842
That's awesome. Serious?

46
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:53,761
That's-That's great, man.

47
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:57,515
I mean, my aunt, she never-
I mean, you know, at your stage...

48
00:06:57,723 --> 00:06:59,934
...I didn't think that could happen.

49
00:07:00,143 --> 00:07:01,602
Yeah.

50
00:07:02,145 --> 00:07:04,313
Mr. White, you kicked its ass, yo!

51
00:07:04,522 --> 00:07:07,316
No. You must be so psyched.

52
00:07:08,401 --> 00:07:10,361
Of course. I am.

53
00:07:11,654 --> 00:07:13,948
Okay, now we...

54
00:07:15,908 --> 00:07:18,369
I mean, what do we...?

55
00:07:18,578 --> 00:07:21,539
Oh, hey, I almost forgot.

56
00:07:26,085 --> 00:07:29,881
So how do you want to...

57
00:07:30,548 --> 00:07:33,134
...you know, proceed...

58
00:07:33,342 --> 00:07:36,012
...in light of this kick-ass news?

59
00:07:38,931 --> 00:07:43,394
We'll take our time
and stay cautious.

60
00:07:43,603 --> 00:07:45,605
Sell off what we have.

61
00:07:45,813 --> 00:07:47,440
And then...

62
00:07:50,902 --> 00:07:54,238
Well, then I guess...

63
00:07:55,615 --> 00:07:57,074
...I'm done.

64
00:08:17,804 --> 00:08:20,264
Batter up.
-Everyone?

65
00:08:21,057 --> 00:08:23,726
Hey, you guys.
I would like to make a toast...

66
00:08:24,352 --> 00:08:28,898
...with my non-alcoholic beverage.
-Somebody kill the music.

67
00:08:29,774 --> 00:08:32,944
I know one party
can't begin to repay...

68
00:08:33,152 --> 00:08:38,366
...all your support
and your many, many kindnesses.

69
00:08:38,574 --> 00:08:40,868
But then again...

70
00:08:41,077 --> 00:08:45,623
...Hank does make
one mean margarita.

71
00:08:49,168 --> 00:08:51,003
We really do want to thank you.

72
00:08:51,212 --> 00:08:54,632
These last few months have been...

73
00:08:55,299 --> 00:08:59,971
...wow, a challenging time,
to put it mildly.

74
00:09:00,179 --> 00:09:02,640
But I have to say
Walt's come through it like a champ.

75
00:09:02,849 --> 00:09:05,977
All right.
-Honey, I'm so proud of you.

76
00:09:06,227 --> 00:09:07,854
We all are.

77
00:09:10,857 --> 00:09:14,485
Okay, I'm gonna stop
with the sappy stuff. I am.

78
00:09:14,694 --> 00:09:16,654
But it's true. It really is.

79
00:09:16,863 --> 00:09:20,324
And for the first time
in a long time...

80
00:09:20,533 --> 00:09:23,494
...we are so excited about the future.

81
00:09:26,539 --> 00:09:28,124
Okay, anyway...

82
00:09:28,332 --> 00:09:31,002
...I want to also
express my gratitude...

83
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:36,174
...to two very special people
who couldn't be here today.

84
00:09:36,382 --> 00:09:39,343
But they send their regrets
and their warm wishes.

85
00:09:39,552 --> 00:09:41,304
Gretchen and Elliott Schwartz...

86
00:09:41,512 --> 00:09:44,515
...for those of you
who don't know them, are...

87
00:09:45,183 --> 00:09:48,478
Well, they're heroes.

88
00:09:48,686 --> 00:09:52,607
They are incredibly generous friends
who made the amazing offer...

89
00:09:52,815 --> 00:09:55,610
...to pay for Walt's treatment.

90
00:09:57,737 --> 00:09:59,363
And they did.

91
00:09:59,697 --> 00:10:01,157
So...

92
00:10:01,949 --> 00:10:03,367
...to Gretchen and Elliott.

93
00:10:03,868 --> 00:10:07,288
To Gretchen and Elliot.
-Cheers.

94
00:10:07,497 --> 00:10:10,374
Hey, how about the man of the hour?
Come on.

95
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:11,959
Speech.
-Yes.

96
00:10:12,168 --> 00:10:13,669
Speech.
-Yeah, Dad.

97
00:10:13,878 --> 00:10:16,255
Come on, Walt. Speech.

98
00:10:18,508 --> 00:10:20,218
Well, it's...

99
00:10:20,426 --> 00:10:21,969
It's kind of funny.

100
00:10:22,512 --> 00:10:27,642
When I got my diagnosis, cancer...

101
00:10:28,392 --> 00:10:32,021
...I said to myself, you know:

102
00:10:32,271 --> 00:10:33,481
"Why me?"

103
00:10:35,691 --> 00:10:37,235
And then...

104
00:10:38,611 --> 00:10:41,739
...the other day,
when I got the good news...

105
00:10:44,951 --> 00:10:47,286
...I said the same thing.

106
00:10:56,754 --> 00:10:58,089
Anyway.

107
00:10:59,423 --> 00:11:01,300
Thank you for coming.

108
00:11:01,843 --> 00:11:05,096
And enjoy.

109
00:11:06,097 --> 00:11:08,933
All right, cheers.
-Yeah.

110
00:11:09,142 --> 00:11:10,476
Cheers.

111
00:11:11,102 --> 00:11:12,895
Inspirational.

112
00:11:13,312 --> 00:11:16,357
Tell you what. I gotta give
those bastards points for originality.

113
00:11:16,566 --> 00:11:17,608
I'll tell you that much.

114
00:11:17,817 --> 00:11:21,404
A little mercury switch,
9-volt battery...

115
00:11:21,612 --> 00:11:25,741
...five or six ounces of C-4,
that's how those cartel boys party.

116
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,744
Yeah, but why a turtle?

117
00:11:28,953 --> 00:11:31,622
Oh, that's the best part. It was a...

118
00:11:31,831 --> 00:11:34,250
It was a... What the hell's the word
I'm looking for?

119
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:38,129
Not a metaphor, not an analogy,
it's a...

120
00:11:38,337 --> 00:11:40,840
Walt, what's the word
I'm looking for?

121
00:11:42,675 --> 00:11:44,177
Anyway...

122
00:11:44,385 --> 00:11:48,139
...Tortuga. Okay?
That was the name of our snitch.

123
00:11:48,347 --> 00:11:50,641
Bean-speak for tortoise. Okay?

124
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:55,563
Tortoise, turtle, what have you.
I never knew the difference myself.

125
00:11:55,771 --> 00:11:58,149
Hey, top me off there,
will you, buddy?

126
00:11:58,357 --> 00:12:00,026
Anyway.

127
00:12:00,568 --> 00:12:02,069
Poetic.

128
00:12:02,278 --> 00:12:06,282
I guess, yeah. Poetic. It was poetic.
That's the word.

129
00:12:06,491 --> 00:12:08,409
I guess that's the word.

130
00:12:28,471 --> 00:12:29,472
Go ahead.

131
00:12:32,892 --> 00:12:36,020
Better not let your mom see.

132
00:12:50,409 --> 00:12:55,373
Oh, yeah, I think I see a hair.
Maybe two.

133
00:12:56,833 --> 00:12:59,710
There's no worm in this, right?
-No, that would be mescal.

134
00:12:59,919 --> 00:13:02,213
Talk about your hangovers, okay?

135
00:13:02,421 --> 00:13:05,508
I was down in Glynco, Georgia.
I was back east, doing some training.

136
00:13:05,716 --> 00:13:09,095
Had this firearm instructor
who was...

137
00:13:09,303 --> 00:13:11,973
He was a good old boy, you know?
Hey. There you go. Thanks.

138
00:13:12,181 --> 00:13:15,560
I mean, this guy could put them away
like he had two livers, okay?

139
00:13:15,768 --> 00:13:18,396
Like a fish, okay? Like a drunk fish.

140
00:13:18,604 --> 00:13:20,565
We were drinking mescal stupid.

141
00:13:20,773 --> 00:13:22,900
But-Hey, hey.

142
00:13:25,444 --> 00:13:28,072
Walt, what you doing there?

143
00:13:28,489 --> 00:13:29,991
What does it look like I'm doing?

144
00:13:31,534 --> 00:13:33,244
The kid's 16.

145
00:13:33,786 --> 00:13:35,872
What are you going for,
Father of the Year?

146
00:13:37,456 --> 00:13:39,667
What are you looking at him for?

147
00:13:46,966 --> 00:13:48,718
We're celebrating. Come on.

148
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:54,515
That's all right.

149
00:14:05,318 --> 00:14:06,611
No.

150
00:14:12,825 --> 00:14:14,452
Jesus.

151
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:24,170
Listen, I'd take a pass on that one
if I were you, okay?

152
00:14:24,378 --> 00:14:27,548
Think we've been bogarting
this puppy long enough.

153
00:14:28,716 --> 00:14:30,134
Hey.

154
00:14:32,178 --> 00:14:35,890
Bring the bottle back.

155
00:14:39,143 --> 00:14:40,937
Sorry, buddy. No can do.

156
00:14:42,063 --> 00:14:44,982
It's my son. My bottle. My house.

157
00:14:48,694 --> 00:14:51,864
It's all right.
-What are you waiting for?

158
00:14:52,073 --> 00:14:53,282
Bring it back.

159
00:15:01,082 --> 00:15:03,000
Why don't we just call it a day?

160
00:15:04,293 --> 00:15:05,837
All right, pal?

161
00:15:08,297 --> 00:15:11,551
We good?
-The bottle.

162
00:15:13,636 --> 00:15:14,679
Now.

163
00:15:22,103 --> 00:15:23,980
What's going on?

164
00:15:29,402 --> 00:15:30,820
Jesus.

165
00:15:34,824 --> 00:15:37,285
Here, sweetie. Okay. Okay.

166
00:15:37,493 --> 00:15:39,162
Oh, my God.

167
00:15:41,289 --> 00:15:43,374
Okay. Okay.

168
00:15:46,586 --> 00:15:49,922
There you go. Okay. That's it.

169
00:15:50,131 --> 00:15:52,425
Just get it out. That's okay.

170
00:16:02,351 --> 00:16:04,854
This is your brain.

171
00:16:08,441 --> 00:16:11,569
This is your brain on drugs.

172
00:16:23,539 --> 00:16:25,458
You weren't supposed to wake up.

173
00:16:25,666 --> 00:16:27,877
Ever or...?

174
00:16:28,794 --> 00:16:33,716
No, I was just thinking
that I'd bring it, you know, in.

175
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:36,427
You want me to go back to bed?

176
00:16:37,178 --> 00:16:39,222
No, I guess that'd be kind of-

177
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:42,767
No.

178
00:16:45,353 --> 00:16:46,896
Need some help?

179
00:16:47,104 --> 00:16:49,023
No, I got it.

180
00:16:50,483 --> 00:16:53,319
Just have a seat.

181
00:16:53,611 --> 00:16:55,363
Is there any coffee?

182
00:16:56,405 --> 00:16:58,783
Yeah, shit. One second.

183
00:16:58,991 --> 00:17:00,952
Well, at least let me do that.

184
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:04,330
No, I don't want you to have
to do anything, you know?

185
00:17:12,463 --> 00:17:15,925
All right. Here.
You take the good one.

186
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:19,137
It's huevos rancheros.

187
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:22,265
I can tell.
-Yeah?

188
00:17:24,934 --> 00:17:27,311
Fork.
-Oh, yeah.

189
00:17:37,155 --> 00:17:38,531
There you go.

190
00:17:39,866 --> 00:17:43,286
So, what are you up to today?
Working?

191
00:17:43,494 --> 00:17:46,998
Whatever that means.
-No.

192
00:17:49,876 --> 00:17:51,669
I'm all yours.

193
00:17:52,044 --> 00:17:53,087
Really?

194
00:18:34,629 --> 00:18:38,633
<i>Hey, this is Skyler.
Please leave me a message. Thanks.</i>

195
00:18:40,843 --> 00:18:42,178
Hi.

196
00:18:44,722 --> 00:18:46,641
I just wanted to say that...

197
00:18:46,849 --> 00:18:48,059
No.

198
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:52,104
We'll talk tonight...

199
00:18:53,606 --> 00:18:56,108
...but I wanted to say that...

200
00:18:57,944 --> 00:19:01,113
...I'm not exactly sure
who that was yesterday...

201
00:19:01,322 --> 00:19:03,241
...but it wasn't me.

202
00:19:06,077 --> 00:19:07,620
And I'm sorry.

203
00:19:10,122 --> 00:19:11,624
Love you.

204
00:19:42,822 --> 00:19:44,615
Oh, boy.

205
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:06,554
<i>I just wanted to say that...</i>

206
00:20:06,762 --> 00:20:07,972
<i>No.</i>

207
00:20:08,556 --> 00:20:12,894
<i>We'll talk tonight,
but I wanted to say that...</i>

208
00:20:13,102 --> 00:20:14,479
Hey there.

209
00:20:14,687 --> 00:20:18,608
Wow, who brought the churros?
-That would be me.

210
00:20:18,816 --> 00:20:22,278
If I leave them at home, I'll just
wind up eating them all myself, so...

211
00:20:24,197 --> 00:20:28,493
They're actually-They're leftovers.
We had a little get-together for Walt.

212
00:20:28,701 --> 00:20:30,620
It wasn't his birthday, was it?

213
00:20:32,079 --> 00:20:33,706
Actually...

214
00:20:33,915 --> 00:20:35,541
...Walt's got...

215
00:20:37,877 --> 00:20:41,672
He's been battling cancer.

216
00:20:42,423 --> 00:20:45,384
Skyler-
-And last week we got good news.

217
00:20:45,593 --> 00:20:49,722
I'm so sorry.
-But we're really optimistic.

218
00:20:49,931 --> 00:20:51,265
Great.

219
00:20:51,766 --> 00:20:54,101
Great. Good news is great.
-Yeah.

220
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:56,771
Yeah, it is. It really is.

221
00:21:00,942 --> 00:21:02,443
Well...

222
00:21:02,902 --> 00:21:05,530
...feel free to bring these any time.

223
00:21:05,738 --> 00:21:07,281
Yeah.

224
00:21:18,334 --> 00:21:20,711
Got some real beauts.

225
00:21:23,589 --> 00:21:27,510
You cannot beat
the thermal efficiency of the C3.

226
00:21:27,718 --> 00:21:29,262
Yeah?

227
00:21:30,304 --> 00:21:33,391
Then again, what about tankless?

228
00:21:34,934 --> 00:21:36,727
Sure. We got them.

229
00:21:36,936 --> 00:21:39,564
The good ones will
really run up your price though.

230
00:21:39,772 --> 00:21:42,859
Set you back about 1200.

231
00:21:43,901 --> 00:21:46,279
It's not an issue.

232
00:21:49,073 --> 00:21:50,366
You want installation, right?

233
00:21:50,575 --> 00:21:55,204
No. I'm gonna do it myself.
-That's what I like to hear.

234
00:22:06,924 --> 00:22:09,969
And who's this?
This guy can surf without a board?

235
00:22:10,887 --> 00:22:13,222
That's Hover Man.

236
00:22:13,431 --> 00:22:16,309
He can surf, skate, glide...

237
00:22:16,517 --> 00:22:21,063
...whatever, because he's always got
a 6-inch cushion of air under his feet.

238
00:22:21,272 --> 00:22:23,774
That's cool. Great lines.

239
00:22:28,404 --> 00:22:30,573
And this guy?
What's his superpower?

240
00:22:31,282 --> 00:22:33,784
That's Kanga-man.

241
00:22:33,993 --> 00:22:36,579
Kanga-man?
Half-man, half-kangaroo?

242
00:22:37,205 --> 00:22:41,083
And who's this in his pouch?
-His sidekick, Joey.

243
00:22:41,792 --> 00:22:44,879
He rides around in his pouch
and, you know...

244
00:22:45,338 --> 00:22:46,672
...fights crime.

245
00:22:46,881 --> 00:22:49,842
So that makes Kanga-man a she.

246
00:22:50,718 --> 00:22:52,470
You know that, right?

247
00:22:52,804 --> 00:22:55,264
Only female kangaroos
have pouches.

248
00:22:55,473 --> 00:22:56,933
Yeah, yeah, I know.

249
00:22:57,141 --> 00:22:59,602
But, you know, it's definitely a dude.

250
00:22:59,811 --> 00:23:02,104
He's a product of experimentation.

251
00:23:02,897 --> 00:23:05,274
He's kind of hot, I guess.
Nice haunches.

252
00:23:08,486 --> 00:23:11,864
And this is?
-It's Backwardo.

253
00:23:12,824 --> 00:23:15,785
Wait, no. I actually-
I changed it to Rewindo.

254
00:23:15,993 --> 00:23:18,079
Anyways, he goes backwards.

255
00:23:18,287 --> 00:23:19,956
He can make everything
go in reverse.

256
00:23:20,164 --> 00:23:22,208
Time and stuff? Like time travelling?

257
00:23:22,416 --> 00:23:24,961
No, he just walks backwards.

258
00:23:25,711 --> 00:23:27,964
He walks backwards?

259
00:23:28,339 --> 00:23:31,342
Is that a superpower?
What good is that?

260
00:23:31,551 --> 00:23:33,928
No, I mean, he does it,
like, really fast.

261
00:23:34,137 --> 00:23:37,056
Okay, look, say someone's
coming at him with a knife, right?

262
00:23:37,265 --> 00:23:40,560
I mean, it's helpful. Then he can just
zip backwards away from them.

263
00:23:40,768 --> 00:23:42,436
Okay.

264
00:23:42,645 --> 00:23:45,148
Yo, I was a kid...

265
00:23:45,356 --> 00:23:46,899
...when I drew all these.

266
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,652
It was like four years ago.

267
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:53,614
They all look like you.
-What?

268
00:23:54,365 --> 00:23:56,659
It's you in all of these.

269
00:23:57,410 --> 00:23:58,995
No.

270
00:23:59,203 --> 00:24:02,206
I wonder what a shrink would say
if he saw them.

271
00:24:02,415 --> 00:24:04,584
Oh, shut up.

272
00:24:04,792 --> 00:24:06,836
Like you never wanted
a superpower.

273
00:24:15,011 --> 00:24:18,598
Is that your door or mine?
-I don't know.

274
00:24:19,932 --> 00:24:21,809
It sounds like mine.

275
00:24:29,901 --> 00:24:32,028
I gotta go.
-Where?

276
00:24:33,571 --> 00:24:36,199
Hey, where?

277
00:24:39,327 --> 00:24:41,370
Hey, hold up. Where are you...?

278
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,340
Jane.

279
00:25:04,352 --> 00:25:05,770
Jane.

280
00:25:19,242 --> 00:25:21,536
Hey, Dad.
-There you are.

281
00:25:22,578 --> 00:25:23,996
Hi, honey.

282
00:25:24,205 --> 00:25:27,166
I saw your car, so I was
pretty sure you were home.

283
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:30,503
Yeah, sorry. I was working.
I had my headphones on.

284
00:25:30,711 --> 00:25:32,922
Finally realised that
I wasn't the drum track?

285
00:25:34,298 --> 00:25:36,676
Exactly.
-Well, I was in the neighbourhood.

286
00:25:36,884 --> 00:25:39,637
Was wondering if you wanted
to grab some lunch.

287
00:25:39,846 --> 00:25:41,097
Sure. Yeah.

288
00:25:41,848 --> 00:25:46,018
Hey, this your dad?

289
00:25:47,395 --> 00:25:48,980
Yes.
-Hello.

290
00:25:49,188 --> 00:25:50,439
Hi.

291
00:25:50,648 --> 00:25:52,358
This is the new tenant.

292
00:25:52,567 --> 00:25:55,194
Donald.
-Jesse.

293
00:25:58,406 --> 00:26:00,867
I'm sorry. Did you need something?

294
00:26:04,871 --> 00:26:06,622
No.
-Dad, why don't you come in?

295
00:26:06,831 --> 00:26:08,416
It was nice seeing you.

296
00:26:08,624 --> 00:26:11,586
It was nice to meet you.
-You too.

297
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,659
Hey, Dad.

298
00:26:44,952 --> 00:26:48,831
Hey, son. Are you home early?
-No.

299
00:26:50,041 --> 00:26:51,667
Oh, man.

300
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,296
It was a good day?

301
00:26:55,922 --> 00:26:59,509
Now it is. Finally, hot water.
No more toxic waste.

302
00:26:59,717 --> 00:27:01,719
Yes. Yes, indeed.

303
00:27:01,928 --> 00:27:05,431
Top of the line, on demand,
unlimited supply.

304
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,016
Sweet.
-Yeah.

305
00:27:07,225 --> 00:27:11,312
Hey, want to take her for a spin?
-Oh, yeah.

306
00:27:11,979 --> 00:27:14,190
Listen, why don't you
go to the kitchen sink?

307
00:27:14,398 --> 00:27:17,610
Let me know when you're ready,
and I'll give you a holler.

308
00:27:17,819 --> 00:27:19,403
Okay.

309
00:27:20,446 --> 00:27:23,366
Pilot in.

310
00:27:23,574 --> 00:27:26,244
Ignition. Bingo.

311
00:27:26,452 --> 00:27:28,037
Okay.

312
00:27:28,663 --> 00:27:31,624
Ready.
-All right. Let her rip.

313
00:27:39,632 --> 00:27:41,717
Hundred and seventeen
thousand BTUs.

314
00:27:41,926 --> 00:27:43,928
Oh, yeah?
-Oh, yeah.

315
00:27:44,137 --> 00:27:46,556
Built-in corrosion-resistant
draught reducer...

316
00:27:46,764 --> 00:27:49,225
...safety thermocouple
with the pilot burner.

317
00:27:49,433 --> 00:27:51,519
Sounds really good, Dad.

318
00:27:52,103 --> 00:27:53,896
And the energy savings. I mean...

319
00:27:54,105 --> 00:27:56,232
Oh, careful, careful, careful.

320
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:59,235
There's probably some adjustments
I need to make. You okay?

321
00:27:59,443 --> 00:28:02,071
Yeah, I'm fine.
-Okay.

322
00:28:05,324 --> 00:28:06,784
Son...

323
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:11,414
...about yesterday-
-I'm sorry about the pool.

324
00:28:12,957 --> 00:28:16,919
No, no, no, that was not your fault.
Not at all.

325
00:28:18,379 --> 00:28:19,839
See, your...

326
00:28:20,423 --> 00:28:22,633
Your old man embarrassed himself...

327
00:28:22,842 --> 00:28:25,094
...and I'm not very proud
of my behaviour.

328
00:28:25,303 --> 00:28:29,098
I have to say I feel very foolish.

329
00:28:31,809 --> 00:28:35,813
You and Uncle Hank,
you seemed pissed off.

330
00:28:36,022 --> 00:28:39,358
No. No. We're fine.
Everything's fine.

331
00:28:39,567 --> 00:28:43,446
I called him this morning
and made my apologies.

332
00:28:46,324 --> 00:28:49,952
But, son, I owe you
an apology most of all.

333
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:53,831
I should have used
better judgement all around.

334
00:28:54,832 --> 00:28:58,044
Having you drink in the first place,
it was not right...

335
00:28:58,252 --> 00:29:00,421
...and for that I'm very sorry.

336
00:29:01,088 --> 00:29:02,882
But I kept up, right?

337
00:29:04,967 --> 00:29:08,971
You and Uncle Hank. I drank three.

338
00:29:16,437 --> 00:29:18,564
I have some tools to put away.

339
00:30:20,751 --> 00:30:22,128
Hey.

340
00:30:24,505 --> 00:30:25,506
Yo.

341
00:30:25,715 --> 00:30:27,884
You want to catch a movie later?

342
00:30:31,262 --> 00:30:32,763
Yo.

343
00:30:34,056 --> 00:30:37,351
What?
-What was that all about?

344
00:30:38,311 --> 00:30:39,645
What?

345
00:30:39,937 --> 00:30:42,273
Before. With your dad.

346
00:30:43,524 --> 00:30:45,026
It wasn't about anything.

347
00:30:45,234 --> 00:30:50,281
Oh, okay, so I totally
just misread your total dis?

348
00:30:50,490 --> 00:30:52,742
If anything, I was doing you a favour.

349
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:54,535
A favour?

350
00:30:55,203 --> 00:30:57,455
Yeah, I told you. He's a hard-ass.

351
00:30:57,663 --> 00:31:00,374
He seemed cool to me.
-Yeah, well.

352
00:31:00,583 --> 00:31:03,920
So, what's the deal?
-There's no deal.

353
00:31:04,128 --> 00:31:07,465
I was helping you out, okay?
Protecting you.

354
00:31:08,633 --> 00:31:10,218
How's that?
-I mean...

355
00:31:11,719 --> 00:31:14,514
...I'm letting you smoke in here
and everything.

356
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,766
I bought a filter.

357
00:31:16,974 --> 00:31:19,352
And I figured
the less he knows, the better.

358
00:31:20,144 --> 00:31:22,605
You acted like
you didn't even know me.

359
00:31:22,814 --> 00:31:24,273
So?

360
00:31:25,983 --> 00:31:27,944
So?
-You think I'm gonna be all like:

361
00:31:28,152 --> 00:31:30,196
"Dad, meet the stoner guy
who lives next door.

362
00:31:30,404 --> 00:31:32,865
And by the way,
I'm sleeping with him"?

363
00:31:34,033 --> 00:31:35,618
That's all you think you're doing?

364
00:31:36,202 --> 00:31:38,454
Why do you even care about my dad?
-I don't.

365
00:31:38,663 --> 00:31:40,957
Good. Then I don't know
why we're talking about it.

366
00:31:41,165 --> 00:31:44,794
Us. All right? I'm talking about us.

367
00:31:45,002 --> 00:31:47,421
Us.
-Yeah.

368
00:31:48,631 --> 00:31:49,632
You and me.

369
00:31:51,467 --> 00:31:53,636
Who's you and me?

370
00:32:01,561 --> 00:32:03,146
I'm out of here.

371
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:46,499
Oh, boy.

372
00:33:56,634 --> 00:33:58,219
Dad?

373
00:34:03,599 --> 00:34:06,018
Dad? Hello?

374
00:34:06,644 --> 00:34:08,437
What? Oh, hey.

375
00:34:09,981 --> 00:34:12,567
What are you doing?
-We've got rot.

376
00:34:12,775 --> 00:34:15,403
Rot?
-Yeah. Here.

377
00:34:15,611 --> 00:34:18,030
I'll show you. Here.

378
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:19,282
Take a look at that.

379
00:34:21,742 --> 00:34:24,745
See that? Yeah.
Ever seen anything like it?

380
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:28,708
It's wood.
-It's wood...

381
00:34:28,916 --> 00:34:30,626
...that contains fruiting bodies.

382
00:34:31,502 --> 00:34:32,545
Fruity what?

383
00:34:33,045 --> 00:34:36,007
Fungus. And it is on a rampage.

384
00:34:36,215 --> 00:34:38,259
I don't really see anything.

385
00:34:38,468 --> 00:34:41,929
Yeah, well, it's there. You just have
to know where to look. Here.

386
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:44,765
Then you cut it all out.

387
00:34:45,391 --> 00:34:47,393
You just cut it out and start fresh.

388
00:34:48,519 --> 00:34:51,189
Well, better get to it.

389
00:34:51,564 --> 00:34:54,484
Is the whole house
gonna collapse or something?

390
00:34:55,193 --> 00:34:57,153
Not if I can help it.

391
00:35:24,889 --> 00:35:27,183
Hey. You bucking for a promotion?

392
00:35:27,725 --> 00:35:31,270
Go home already.
-I will. I will.

393
00:35:33,523 --> 00:35:36,025
Hey, can I just ask...

394
00:35:37,026 --> 00:35:39,737
...the Keller account?
-The Keller account?

395
00:35:39,946 --> 00:35:43,616
It's listed as a current asset
on this balance sheet...

396
00:35:43,825 --> 00:35:47,870
...but the invoice was never presented
to accounts receivable, so...

397
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:49,121
Oh, God.

398
00:35:49,330 --> 00:35:52,542
One of these days I'm gonna just
sort through all the Dad stuff.

399
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:56,045
He had so many "Don't worry about it,
pay me Friday" relationships...

400
00:35:56,254 --> 00:35:58,256
...with these little companies.

401
00:35:58,714 --> 00:36:02,051
We'll figure it out tomorrow. Or not.

402
00:36:03,136 --> 00:36:04,554
Right.

403
00:36:05,304 --> 00:36:08,266
Seriously, you're not gonna
make me lock you in, are you?

404
00:36:08,933 --> 00:36:10,434
Sky?

405
00:36:12,603 --> 00:36:13,688
Skyler?

406
00:36:14,856 --> 00:36:16,566
Jesus.

407
00:36:18,818 --> 00:36:21,028
No, I'm fine.

408
00:36:22,196 --> 00:36:26,325
It's hormones. Honestly.
It happens all the time.

409
00:36:27,535 --> 00:36:29,370
I'll see you tomorrow.

410
00:36:36,544 --> 00:36:37,920
What's wrong?

411
00:36:41,549 --> 00:36:43,384
I guess it just...

412
00:36:46,137 --> 00:36:49,599
...doesn't feel any different.

413
00:36:53,895 --> 00:36:57,106
The good news?

414
00:36:58,357 --> 00:37:02,445
I mean, nothing's really changed.

415
00:37:04,238 --> 00:37:06,282
It's just postponed.

416
00:37:08,201 --> 00:37:11,287
There was supposed to be a light
at the end of the tunnel.

417
00:37:15,666 --> 00:37:17,960
But lately, it just feels like...

418
00:37:19,921 --> 00:37:21,547
More tunnel.

419
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:23,800
I'm sorry.

420
00:37:29,847 --> 00:37:32,558
I just feel so damn ungrateful.

421
00:37:33,351 --> 00:37:35,353
I don't know.

422
00:37:36,187 --> 00:37:37,939
For me, it was the flu.

423
00:37:38,523 --> 00:37:41,818
What?
-My dad rallied at the end.

424
00:37:42,026 --> 00:37:44,403
I mean, it wasn't the full-on
good news Walt got...

425
00:37:44,612 --> 00:37:47,156
...different circumstances,
but we were happy...

426
00:37:47,365 --> 00:37:48,991
...we were over the moon.

427
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:52,453
And right then, I got sick.

428
00:37:53,037 --> 00:37:55,665
Flu.
Knocked me on my ass for days.

429
00:37:55,873 --> 00:37:58,751
Couldn't get out of bed,
I couldn't move.

430
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:01,838
Great timing, huh?
-Yeah.

431
00:38:03,214 --> 00:38:06,884
And I wasn't even putting two
and two together. I was just thinking:

432
00:38:07,093 --> 00:38:08,678
"Why now?"

433
00:38:11,764 --> 00:38:13,724
Being that rock.

434
00:38:14,892 --> 00:38:16,352
You know...

435
00:38:16,894 --> 00:38:21,274
...being that rock
takes everything you got.

436
00:38:27,655 --> 00:38:29,115
Yeah.

437
00:39:25,379 --> 00:39:27,381
<i>-causing the housing prices
to trend.</i>

438
00:39:27,590 --> 00:39:31,093
<i>Foreclosures are being fuelled
by a spike in...</i>

439
00:39:34,096 --> 00:39:38,309
<i>The economy is rapidly deteriorating
and unemployment is climbing.</i>

440
00:39:38,518 --> 00:39:42,271
<i>With Americans losing money over
rising inflation and tight spending...</i>

441
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,941
<i>...the housing market
is unlikely to rebound...</i>

442
00:39:45,149 --> 00:39:47,819
<i>...spelling more pain
for the economy.</i>

443
00:39:57,036 --> 00:39:58,621
Yeah.

444
00:40:16,764 --> 00:40:19,392
Are you going to work today?

445
00:40:21,811 --> 00:40:23,938
Skyler, there's rot.

446
00:40:32,989 --> 00:40:34,490
I'm going back.

447
00:42:06,958 --> 00:42:10,795
All right. We'll take care of that
tomorrow. Okay, good night.

448
00:42:17,009 --> 00:42:19,262
Good night, Ted.
-Good night.

449
00:42:21,681 --> 00:42:23,683
Oh, damn.

450
00:42:25,977 --> 00:42:27,645
Clumsy.
-I got it.

451
00:42:27,854 --> 00:42:30,106
No, no, Ted.
You don't have to do that.

452
00:42:59,135 --> 00:43:02,722
<i>Get organised. Storage containers
to meet every need...</i>

453
00:43:02,930 --> 00:43:05,516
<i>...big or small, on Aisle 3.</i>

454

<i>Why can't the grass
always be greener on your side?</i>

457
00:43:28,206 --> 00:43:30,833
<i>Go to Aisle 10 to go green.</i>

458

<i>Get a manager

459
00:43:38,382 --> 00:43:40,510
<i>Manager to Check out 4.</i>

<i>Your extermination destination
is Aisle 6.</i>

462
00:43:56,317 --> 00:43:58,528
You're buying the wrong matches.

463
00:43:59,195 --> 00:44:01,197
What?
-Those matches.

464
00:44:01,405 --> 00:44:02,657
They're the wrong kind.

465
00:44:03,616 --> 00:44:06,035
Red phosphorous is found
in the striker strips...

466
00:44:06,244 --> 00:44:08,121
...not the matches themselves.

467
00:44:08,329 --> 00:44:12,041
You need to get the big 200-count box
of individual matchbooks.

468
00:44:16,504 --> 00:44:18,214
More striker strips. You understand?

469
00:44:19,048 --> 00:44:21,175
Those only have the one.

470
00:44:21,384 --> 00:44:23,886
And don't buy everything
in one place.

471
00:44:24,095 --> 00:44:25,346
Do it piecemeal.

472
00:44:25,555 --> 00:44:29,016
Different items, different stores.
Attracts less attention.

473
00:44:32,937 --> 00:44:34,480
Are you following me here?

474
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:42,738
<i>You've been putting off
refinishing that deck long enough.</i>

to do the job right.</i>

476
00:44:50,580 --> 00:44:52,165
Thanks.
-Sure.

477
00:44:52,373 --> 00:44:54,417
Next.
-Hi. Here you go.

478
00:45:24,655 --> 00:45:26,782
You didn't buy my stuff?
-No, I didn't.

479
00:45:26,991 --> 00:45:28,576
We don't have time for this.

480
00:45:36,167 --> 00:45:38,294
Hey, there he is. That's the guy.

481
00:45:56,103 --> 00:45:59,440
Stay out of my territory.
