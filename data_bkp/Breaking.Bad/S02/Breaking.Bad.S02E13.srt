1
00:02:51,605 --> 00:02:53,690
Come on.

2
00:02:55,233 --> 00:02:56,944
Come on.

3
00:02:57,444 --> 00:02:59,196
Come...

4
00:02:59,404 --> 00:03:02,240
Come on. Come on, baby.

5
00:03:02,908 --> 00:03:07,913
Please, please. Come on, come on.
Come on!

6
00:03:34,773 --> 00:03:38,443
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.

7
00:04:07,848 --> 00:04:09,266
Yeah.

8
00:04:11,393 --> 00:04:15,480
Slow down. Slow-Slow down.

9
00:04:15,689 --> 00:04:18,734
And just-Just take a deep breath.

10
00:04:19,151 --> 00:04:20,569
Do it.

11
00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:22,821
All right.

12
00:04:23,822 --> 00:04:25,574
Now, what happened?

13
00:04:38,378 --> 00:04:42,174
All right. All right. Now...

14
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:47,512
...listen-Listen to me.
Are you listening?

15
00:04:48,347 --> 00:04:51,224
Everything is gonna be okay.
I promise.

16
00:04:51,433 --> 00:04:53,477
No, no-Listen. Calm down.

17
00:04:53,685 --> 00:04:55,187
Just...

18
00:04:56,063 --> 00:04:59,608
Sit tight. I know who to call.

19
00:05:26,969 --> 00:05:28,136
Saul Goodman sent me.

20
00:05:37,813 --> 00:05:40,524
Come on. Inside.

21
00:05:47,948 --> 00:05:49,741
Watch the door.

22
00:05:52,828 --> 00:05:54,579
Where is she?

23
00:07:24,044 --> 00:07:26,505
Any other drugs in the house?

24
00:07:32,052 --> 00:07:35,472
Think hard.
Your freedom depends on it.

25
00:07:37,516 --> 00:07:39,518
What about guns?
You got any guns in the house?

26
00:07:42,104 --> 00:07:43,605
Here's your story.

27
00:07:43,814 --> 00:07:47,359
You woke up. You found her.
That's all you know.

28
00:07:47,901 --> 00:07:49,444
Say it.

29
00:07:50,737 --> 00:07:55,033
Say it, please. "I woke up. I found her.
That's all I know."

30
00:07:58,412 --> 00:08:01,039
Say it. "I woke up. I found her.
That's all I know."

31
00:08:01,248 --> 00:08:03,125
I woke up. I found her.
That's all I know.

32
00:08:03,667 --> 00:08:04,668
Again.

33
00:08:05,544 --> 00:08:07,504
I woke up. I found her.
That's all I know.

34
00:08:07,713 --> 00:08:09,298
Again. Again.

35
00:08:09,506 --> 00:08:12,467
I woke up. I found her.
That's all I know.

36
00:08:12,676 --> 00:08:16,054
I woke up. I found her.
That's all I know.

37
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,353
Once you call,
the people who show up...

38
00:08:23,562 --> 00:08:26,148
...will be with
the Office of Medical Investigations.

39
00:08:26,356 --> 00:08:28,734
That's primarily who you'll talk to.

40
00:08:28,942 --> 00:08:31,236
Police officers may arrive,
they may not.

41
00:08:31,445 --> 00:08:33,530
Depends on how busy
a morning they're having.

42
00:08:33,739 --> 00:08:36,241
Typically, ODs are not
a high-priority call.

43
00:08:36,992 --> 00:08:38,702
There's nothing to incriminate you...

44
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:41,246
...so I'd be amazed
if you got placed under arrest.

45
00:08:42,122 --> 00:08:46,877
However, if you do, you say nothing.

46
00:08:47,085 --> 00:08:49,212
You tell them
you just want your lawyer.

47
00:08:49,421 --> 00:08:51,632
Then you call Saul Goodman.

48
00:08:52,549 --> 00:08:55,260
And do I need to state the obvious?

49
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:59,389
I was not here.

50
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:11,234
You put on a long-sleeved shirt...

51
00:09:11,443 --> 00:09:13,362
...and cover
those track marks on your arm.

52
00:09:17,407 --> 00:09:20,702
Count down from 20,
and then you dial.

53
00:09:33,006 --> 00:09:36,510
Hang tough.
You're in the home stretch.

54
00:10:02,536 --> 00:10:05,247
Do you want 2-percent or skim?

55
00:10:05,455 --> 00:10:09,334
Two.
-Two. All right.

56
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:13,714
Thank you.

57
00:10:17,551 --> 00:10:19,177
Junior.

58
00:10:24,558 --> 00:10:26,393
Junior.

59
00:10:26,977 --> 00:10:29,396
Flynn.
-What?

60
00:10:30,564 --> 00:10:32,024
Flynn.

61
00:10:34,359 --> 00:10:35,986
Flynn.

62
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,697
I'll be there in a minute.

63
00:10:43,744 --> 00:10:45,537
You all right?

64
00:10:50,584 --> 00:10:53,920
Flynn, get your butt in here.

65
00:10:54,671 --> 00:10:57,966
Oh, my God. Mom, Dad, come here.
You gotta see this.

66
00:10:58,175 --> 00:11:00,177
Seriously.

67
00:11:03,013 --> 00:11:07,559
What?
-Look right there. Look at that.

68
00:11:10,187 --> 00:11:11,188
Are those donations?

69
00:11:11,396 --> 00:11:13,065
Yes.
-Actual donations for your dad?

70
00:11:16,109 --> 00:11:20,864
Total strangers gave us $490.

71
00:11:21,073 --> 00:11:25,911
Twenty-six people.
Virginia, Minnesota, Montana.

72
00:11:26,119 --> 00:11:29,581
Look at this one. Vancouver.
All the way up in Canada.

73
00:11:30,123 --> 00:11:33,168
And it's all real, actual money.

74
00:11:33,669 --> 00:11:37,506
It's actually right there
in the PayPal account.

75
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:41,593
And look what they're saying.

76
00:11:41,802 --> 00:11:46,098
"Hang in there, Walt." "Good luck."
"Hang in there."

77
00:11:47,099 --> 00:11:49,226
Isn't this awesome?

78
00:11:51,311 --> 00:11:55,732
That's-Wow, that is something.

79
00:11:57,651 --> 00:12:00,404
Walt, don't you think
a little thank-you is in order?

80
00:12:01,363 --> 00:12:04,700
Yes, absolutely. Thank you, son.

81
00:12:04,908 --> 00:12:08,120
Thank you. This is a big, big help.

82
00:12:09,454 --> 00:12:14,668
Oh, look, 20 more bucks
from Thunder Bay, Ontario.

83
00:12:14,876 --> 00:12:19,881
Damn. Five hundred and ten dollars.

84
00:12:28,348 --> 00:12:31,518
<i>If you're trying to sell me something,
I've got four words for you.:</i>

85
00:12:31,727 --> 00:12:32,728
<i>"Do-not-call list."</i>

86
00:12:32,936 --> 00:12:35,731
<i>However, if you're cool,
leave it at the beep.</i>

87
00:12:35,939 --> 00:12:38,567
How did I know you wouldn't be
answering your phone?

88
00:12:38,775 --> 00:12:40,819
I'm on my way.
I'm gonna be there momentarily.

89
00:12:41,028 --> 00:12:46,617
I expect you on the porch, bag packed,
ready to go. No excuses.

90
00:13:30,327 --> 00:13:33,956
Sir, you may not wanna
be here for this.

91
00:13:51,765 --> 00:13:57,854
I just woke up and I found her.

92
00:13:58,063 --> 00:13:59,898
That's all I know.

93
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,401
What's her date of birth?

94
00:14:08,615 --> 00:14:12,244
Sir, your daughter's date of birth?

95
00:14:13,203 --> 00:14:14,663
April...

96
00:14:14,871 --> 00:14:18,750
April 4th, 1982.
-Okay.

97
00:14:19,209 --> 00:14:23,630
And mother's maiden name
and place of birth.

98
00:14:24,423 --> 00:14:27,175
My mother?
-Your daughter's mother.

99
00:14:28,594 --> 00:14:30,012
Bishop.

100
00:14:31,763 --> 00:14:35,017
And place of birth?
-Phoenix.

101
00:14:36,643 --> 00:14:37,978
Phoenix, Arizona?

102
00:14:42,816 --> 00:14:43,900
This is our address.

103
00:14:44,651 --> 00:14:46,361
Do you have someone
who can drive you?

104
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:47,988
I can drive.

105
00:14:48,196 --> 00:14:50,157
Well, then if you'd like
to meet us there...

106
00:14:50,365 --> 00:14:52,784
...we can complete the intake
and take our samples...

107
00:14:52,993 --> 00:14:55,287
...and then you can make
your arrangements.

108
00:14:55,495 --> 00:14:56,830
Okay?

109
00:14:57,039 --> 00:15:00,584
Now, do you need a card?
Will you both be coming?

110
00:15:24,691 --> 00:15:28,153
I don't believe it.
Walt, you have to see this.

111
00:15:28,362 --> 00:15:30,364
Forty from Te-
-Terre Haute.

112
00:15:30,572 --> 00:15:31,573
Walt.

113
00:15:42,084 --> 00:15:43,085
<i>It's me.</i>

114
00:15:43,293 --> 00:15:45,420
<i>Are you there? Hello.</i>

115
00:15:46,546 --> 00:15:49,883
I'm just checking in.

116
00:15:50,467 --> 00:15:54,429
Our friend says
he thinks everything went well.

117
00:15:54,638 --> 00:15:56,974
That's-That's good.

118
00:15:57,182 --> 00:16:01,353
So listen. Just call me, all right?

119
00:16:01,561 --> 00:16:06,525
Hey, Walt, you've gotta come in here.
We just broke a thousand dollars.

120
00:16:09,653 --> 00:16:12,447
All right. I'm coming.

121
00:16:13,865 --> 00:16:16,868
Some of you already know
my brother-in-law. He's a good man.

122
00:16:17,077 --> 00:16:20,038
The doctors say this operation
has a real chance of helping him.

123
00:16:20,247 --> 00:16:24,501
They're also saying they wanna
be paid in private islands, so dig deep.

124
00:16:25,377 --> 00:16:26,795
Biggest donation...

125
00:16:27,004 --> 00:16:29,840
...gets a six-pack
of my very own Schraderbrau.

126
00:16:30,674 --> 00:16:32,551
Home-brewed to silky perfection.

127
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:34,595
Smallest donation
gets two six-packs.

128
00:16:34,803 --> 00:16:37,931
All right. Other than Gomie here
pees sitting down...

129
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:39,182
...here's what we know.

130
00:16:39,391 --> 00:16:41,768
Christian Ortega, a.k.a. Combo.

131
00:16:41,977 --> 00:16:44,563
Shot dead
by an unknown assailant last month.

132
00:16:44,771 --> 00:16:46,398
"Combo?" I hear you say.

133
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:50,569
"Why, I'm unfamiliar with that name.
Was he a Nobel laureate perchance?"

134
00:16:50,777 --> 00:16:53,405
No. He was a dipshit
wannabe banger.

135
00:16:53,614 --> 00:16:56,158
Now, no arrests,
save for stealing a baby Jesus...

136
00:16:56,366 --> 00:16:58,952
...from a Knights of Columbus manger
back when he was 17.

137
00:16:59,161 --> 00:17:03,123
This dude was so low-rep,
he never showed up on our radar.

138
00:17:03,457 --> 00:17:05,167
So why am I talking about him?

139
00:17:06,126 --> 00:17:08,795
Anyone? Anyone?

140
00:17:09,004 --> 00:17:10,005
Bueller?

141
00:17:10,464 --> 00:17:12,424
He was dealing Blue Sky.
-That's right.

142
00:17:12,633 --> 00:17:15,427
Now, how is it that the purest,
most professional grade...

143
00:17:15,636 --> 00:17:20,265
...of meth we've ever come across
is being slung by the likes of that?

144
00:17:20,474 --> 00:17:21,934
But wait. It gets better.

145
00:17:22,142 --> 00:17:25,270
Since baby-Jesus thief there
slowed a bullet with his neck...

146
00:17:25,479 --> 00:17:27,522
...the blue stuff's
vanished from town, okay?

147
00:17:27,731 --> 00:17:30,651
Not a speck to be found
in Albuquerque. Now, why is that?

148
00:17:31,735 --> 00:17:36,239
Well, because maybe
your Heisenberg's in prison.

149
00:17:37,157 --> 00:17:39,534
So says A.P.D.
They think they got their man.

150
00:17:39,743 --> 00:17:42,162
I know you don't buy it,
but maybe it's true.

151
00:17:42,371 --> 00:17:48,085
James Edward Kilkelly, yeah.
A.P.D. thinks this is our mastermind.

152
00:17:48,293 --> 00:17:50,295
You believe that,
I got a bridge to sell you.

153
00:17:50,504 --> 00:17:53,131
He copped to it, didn't he?
-For an extra pudding cup...

154
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:54,675
...every night at Los Lunas?

155
00:17:54,883 --> 00:17:56,969
Maybe if you give him
a pack of cigarettes...

156
00:17:57,177 --> 00:18:00,430
...he'll tell you what
he did with Jimmy Hoffa. No, no, no.

157
00:18:00,639 --> 00:18:01,932
I've been thinking.

158
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:06,645
Top-shelf product like this?
It doesn't fall off the face of the earth.

159
00:18:06,853 --> 00:18:08,772
Raw talent's bound
to pop up somewhere.

160
00:18:08,981 --> 00:18:11,650
It's like Whack-A-Mole.
So I've been making phone calls.

161
00:18:11,858 --> 00:18:15,237
Local police departments,
small-town sheriffs.

162
00:18:16,196 --> 00:18:18,615
Haven't had much luck
inside the Land of Enchantment.

163
00:18:18,824 --> 00:18:21,368
But outside,
I've got reports of the blue stuff...

164
00:18:21,576 --> 00:18:24,579
...making a scene here in Texas,
Arizona, Colorado and Nevada.

165
00:18:24,788 --> 00:18:28,917
In fact, everywhere but here.

166
00:18:29,459 --> 00:18:34,047
Almost as if somebody wised up,
stopped shitting where they eat.

167
00:18:35,215 --> 00:18:36,592
Now...

168
00:18:37,384 --> 00:18:40,012
...I say Heisenberg's still out there.

169
00:18:40,762 --> 00:18:43,181
I say he's gone regional.

170
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:45,601
Only he's still right here in town.

171
00:18:46,727 --> 00:18:49,521
Come on, 2800.

172
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:53,025
Come on, big 28. You can do it.

173
00:18:53,233 --> 00:18:55,861
Only 30 more dollars. Thirty more.

174
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:59,698
Fo-Forty dollars! Twenty-eight ten.

175
00:18:59,906 --> 00:19:01,366
Yes!
-Yes!

176
00:19:05,162 --> 00:19:06,163
Who's gonna be next?

177
00:19:06,371 --> 00:19:08,165
Your guy found him?

178
00:19:08,665 --> 00:19:10,417
Where is he?

179
00:19:10,626 --> 00:19:11,627
Okay, listen.

180
00:19:11,835 --> 00:19:13,337
No, no, I don't care.

181
00:19:13,545 --> 00:19:15,172
You have your guy pick-

182
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:17,382
Saul. Just shut-Saul.

183
00:19:17,591 --> 00:19:20,886
Saul, shut up
and give me the address.

184
00:19:24,097 --> 00:19:25,682
I don't recommend it.

185
00:19:27,059 --> 00:19:29,019
A.P.D.'s been known
to sit on this place...

186
00:19:29,227 --> 00:19:31,897
..keep an eye
on the comings and goings.

187
00:19:32,606 --> 00:19:33,982
Are they here now?

188
00:19:34,191 --> 00:19:38,070
Well, I don't see any sign,
but that's the point.

189
00:19:39,237 --> 00:19:41,365
Police could be the least of it.

190
00:19:41,573 --> 00:19:43,533
You could just get mugged or shot.

191
00:19:45,911 --> 00:19:48,914
How about you go on home, Walter?

192
00:19:49,122 --> 00:19:51,124
Let me handle this.

193
00:20:20,862 --> 00:20:22,364
Yo.

194
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:23,300
Jesse.

195
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:29,389
Jesse. Jesse. Look at me, son.

196
00:21:29,598 --> 00:21:32,517
Wake up. Wake up.
-Hey.

197
00:21:32,726 --> 00:21:36,396
I ain't got nothing for you, man.
It's all gone.

198
00:21:36,605 --> 00:21:38,607
Jesse, damn it, wake up. Just-

199
00:21:38,815 --> 00:21:42,069
Jesse, Jesse. Jesse, it's me.
Okay, it's me. It's Walt. It's Walt.

200
00:21:42,277 --> 00:21:43,403
Jesse.

201
00:21:43,612 --> 00:21:46,281
Yeah.
-Come on, let's get out of here.

202
00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:50,118
No, no, no.

203
00:21:50,327 --> 00:21:52,329
I'm good.
-Come on. Help me out now.

204
00:21:52,537 --> 00:21:55,874
I'm good. I'm good.
Right here, man. Right here.

205
00:21:56,083 --> 00:21:59,252
Listen, Jesse, you are not good
right here.

206
00:21:59,461 --> 00:22:01,630
You are not good at all. You hear?

207
00:22:02,172 --> 00:22:05,509
Now, you just put your arms
around me. Come on.

208
00:22:05,717 --> 00:22:07,094
You're gonna stand up...

209
00:22:07,302 --> 00:22:09,763
...and we're gonna
walk out of here, okay?

210
00:22:09,972 --> 00:22:12,015
We're gonna take you
someplace nice and safe.

211
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:15,477
That's it. Now, let's go.
Come on. Here we go.

212
00:22:43,422 --> 00:22:45,424
I killed her.

213
00:22:45,632 --> 00:22:48,677
What?
-I killed her. It was me.

214
00:22:48,885 --> 00:22:50,512
I killed her, man. I killed her.
-No.

215
00:22:50,721 --> 00:22:53,849
Jesse, look at me. Look at me.

216
00:22:54,057 --> 00:22:55,475
You didn't kill anybody.

217
00:22:56,852 --> 00:22:59,146
I loved her.

218
00:23:01,565 --> 00:23:05,485
I loved her more than anything.

219
00:23:15,078 --> 00:23:19,625
No, no. No.

220
00:24:08,674 --> 00:24:10,759
I haven't given much thought
to the programs.

221
00:24:10,968 --> 00:24:13,178
I guess they should be...

222
00:24:14,346 --> 00:24:17,933
I don't know.
Just use your best judgement.

223
00:24:19,268 --> 00:24:21,561
There's no yellow dress here.

224
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:25,399
It's all-It's all black and grey.

225
00:24:27,234 --> 00:24:30,070
When's the last time you saw her
ever wearing a yellow dress?

226
00:24:31,863 --> 00:24:33,907
What about blue?

227
00:24:34,116 --> 00:24:37,411
Blue's better than black, right?

228
00:24:38,036 --> 00:24:41,248
No, no. Not dark blue. More like...

229
00:24:41,456 --> 00:24:45,460
Not super-bright, either.

230
00:24:45,669 --> 00:24:47,337
I mean, blue is blue.

231
00:24:47,546 --> 00:24:51,133
No. No cleavage.

232
00:24:52,509 --> 00:24:54,428
Long sleeves.

233
00:24:56,013 --> 00:24:58,890
Yeah. It's nice.

234
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:02,144
It's nice.

235
00:25:07,816 --> 00:25:09,651
Big yawn, Holly.

236
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:12,863
I know what you feel like.
I'm tired too.

237
00:25:15,157 --> 00:25:17,951
Okay, sweetie.
-Yes.

238
00:25:20,412 --> 00:25:21,872
Yes!

239
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:24,541
Here we go.

240
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:28,378
Here we go. Yes.

241
00:25:34,426 --> 00:25:37,804
Would you mind
turning that thing down or off?

242
00:25:38,347 --> 00:25:40,682
Junior. Hey.

243
00:25:41,725 --> 00:25:44,603
The dinging.
Just turn down the volume.

244
00:25:44,811 --> 00:25:49,441
Dad, it's money.
-Just please do it.

245
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:52,152
Okay, the noise
is disturbing the baby.

246
00:25:54,947 --> 00:25:56,949
Marie, slow down. I can't-

247
00:25:59,117 --> 00:26:02,120
Oh, my God. You are kidding me.

248
00:26:02,621 --> 00:26:05,832
Sure. Of course.
Any day after school.

249
00:26:06,041 --> 00:26:09,836
Okay. Wait. I'm gonna-Let me tell him,
and I'll call you right back.

250
00:26:10,045 --> 00:26:11,421
Okay.

251
00:26:13,131 --> 00:26:14,758
Guess what.
-What?

252
00:26:14,967 --> 00:26:17,469
You are gonna be in the newspaper.
-No way.

253
00:26:17,678 --> 00:26:19,680
<i>One of Marie's patients
works at the Journal.</i>

254
00:26:19,888 --> 00:26:22,182
She told him about the website
and the donations...

255
00:26:22,391 --> 00:26:24,726
...and they're gonna do a story
about you.

256
00:26:24,935 --> 00:26:25,936
For real?
-Yep.

257
00:26:26,144 --> 00:26:29,147
They're coming to interview you
with a photo and everything.

258
00:26:29,356 --> 00:26:30,941
Awesome.

259
00:26:31,149 --> 00:26:35,737
It'll mean more hits.
-And more contributions.

260
00:26:40,534 --> 00:26:42,452
East of Scottsdale?

261
00:26:42,661 --> 00:26:45,080
Let me guess. Not talking.

262
00:26:45,956 --> 00:26:47,749
Nope. Not a one.

263
00:26:47,958 --> 00:26:50,877
Someone somewhere
is running one tight ship.

264
00:26:53,213 --> 00:26:55,632
All right, chief. Yeah. Thanks a lot.

265
00:26:55,841 --> 00:26:57,593
Yeah. You too.

266
00:27:01,471 --> 00:27:03,265
Agent Schrader,
can you spare a moment?

267
00:27:03,473 --> 00:27:05,642
Yes, sir. Absolutely.

268
00:27:08,604 --> 00:27:11,481
Gentlemen, this is
Supervising Agent Hank Schrader.

269
00:27:11,982 --> 00:27:15,777
Agent Schrader, I'd like you to meet
Andrew Coffman of the Adobe Hotel.

270
00:27:15,986 --> 00:27:17,738
Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

271
00:27:17,946 --> 00:27:20,032
Paul Canterna
of Canterna Real Estate.

272
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,075
Hey, it's a pleasure.
-Good to meet you.

273
00:27:22,284 --> 00:27:25,787
And Gustavo Fring
of Los Pollos Hermanos.

274
00:27:25,996 --> 00:27:28,081
Please, just Gus.
-Hi, Gus.

275
00:27:28,290 --> 00:27:30,083
You guys make some killer chicken.

276
00:27:30,876 --> 00:27:31,877
Thank you very much.

277
00:27:32,085 --> 00:27:34,588
These gentlemen are underwriting
this year's Fun Run...

278
00:27:34,796 --> 00:27:36,632
...and I thought
I would give them a tour.

279
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:39,426
Absolutely. Get to see
what you're supporting. Thank you.

280
00:27:39,635 --> 00:27:41,720
Can you tell us a little
about your work here?

281
00:27:41,929 --> 00:27:43,430
Yes, the Albuquerque office...

282
00:27:43,639 --> 00:27:46,266
...covers everything
from drug-related money laundering...

283
00:27:46,475 --> 00:27:49,227
...to interdiction of illicit substances
crossing the border.

284
00:27:49,811 --> 00:27:53,231
Now, the group that I supervise
focuses on methamphetamine...

285
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:56,443
...which is a growing problem
in the country, unfortunately.

286
00:27:56,652 --> 00:27:58,987
Terrible.
-Yeah. It is indeed.

287
00:27:59,196 --> 00:28:00,781
We've had
some successes locally...

288
00:28:00,989 --> 00:28:03,075
...but overall,
the supply seems to be growing.

289
00:28:03,283 --> 00:28:06,870
I gotta tell you, community outreach,
like this Fun Run...

290
00:28:07,079 --> 00:28:09,247
...one of the most powerful
weapons we have.

291
00:28:09,456 --> 00:28:10,666
Anything we can do.

292
00:28:10,874 --> 00:28:12,292
Thank you.
-Thank you, Hank.

293
00:28:12,501 --> 00:28:13,627
Gentlemen.
-Thanks.

294
00:28:13,835 --> 00:28:15,504
Sure. Thank you.

295
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:18,173
Is this one of your agents?

296
00:28:18,382 --> 00:28:22,344
Oh, yeah, no, no,
that's my brother-in-law.

297
00:28:22,552 --> 00:28:24,513
He's got a health issue.
We're trying to-

298
00:28:24,721 --> 00:28:28,141
Oh, I'm very sorry.
What sort of health issue?

299
00:28:29,184 --> 00:28:32,980
Lung cancer.
-Oh, that's a rough one.

300
00:28:33,814 --> 00:28:38,944
Oh, hey, you don't have to do that.
-Please. Please. I'm happy to do it.

301
00:28:41,029 --> 00:28:42,739
Thank you very much.
-You're welcome.

302
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:05,053
Just so you know,
I won't be back for a while.

303
00:29:05,887 --> 00:29:08,849
I'm gonna have
my surgery on Friday.

304
00:29:11,435 --> 00:29:13,854
I'm hopeful it'll go well.

305
00:29:15,897 --> 00:29:18,859
But if not,
Saul will take care of things.

306
00:29:19,067 --> 00:29:22,279
He's got your money.
He's keeping it for you.

307
00:29:33,915 --> 00:29:37,919
Look, Jesse, lingering on things
doesn't help, believe me.

308
00:29:38,128 --> 00:29:42,341
Just try and focus
on getting better, okay.

309
00:29:43,342 --> 00:29:45,385
I deserve this.

310
00:29:46,386 --> 00:29:47,846
What?

311
00:29:49,765 --> 00:29:52,726
What you said in the desert.

312
00:29:52,935 --> 00:29:56,647
I get it, what you meant.

313
00:30:00,859 --> 00:30:03,236
I deserve whatever happens.

314
00:30:23,632 --> 00:30:25,634
Oh, shit.

315
00:30:41,149 --> 00:30:42,818
There he is!

316
00:30:43,568 --> 00:30:46,697
Walt, they're doing a feature
on Walter Jr.

317
00:30:46,905 --> 00:30:49,283
We called you about 50 times.

318
00:30:49,491 --> 00:30:52,869
Marie, I thought we were just talking
about a newspaper story.

319
00:30:53,078 --> 00:30:56,498
<i>I know. But I thought, you know,
if it's good enough for the Journal...</i>

320
00:30:56,707 --> 00:31:00,252
...then why not TV? So I went for it.

321
00:31:01,628 --> 00:31:02,921
This is him?
-Yes.

322
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:04,506
This is Dad. Great.

323
00:31:04,715 --> 00:31:07,968
Let's get everyone on the couch.
I'm thinking Walt Jr. in the middle...

324
00:31:08,176 --> 00:31:10,095
...Mom and Dad on either side.

325
00:31:10,304 --> 00:31:11,722
Mom and Dad?

326
00:31:13,765 --> 00:31:16,560
How much money
have you raised so far?

327
00:31:17,102 --> 00:31:20,814
Six thousand, three hundred
and sixty dollars.

328
00:31:21,023 --> 00:31:23,066
But there's more coming in
all the time.

329
00:31:23,275 --> 00:31:26,111
Wow, that's amazing.
-We don't even know what to say.

330
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:29,781
It's just-It's been incredible.

331
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:32,200
Judging from things you have
written about him...

332
00:31:32,409 --> 00:31:38,123
...your dad must be quite a guy.
-Yeah. He is. He's the best.

333
00:31:38,332 --> 00:31:40,792
You don't wanna lose him,
do you, Walter?

334
00:31:41,001 --> 00:31:45,172
None of us do. We love him.

335
00:31:45,797 --> 00:31:50,135
He's a good man, isn't he?
-Absolutely. Ask anyone.

336
00:31:51,094 --> 00:31:54,222
Anybody. He's a great father,
a great teacher.

337
00:31:54,431 --> 00:31:57,017
He knows everything there is
to know about chemistry.

338
00:31:57,601 --> 00:32:01,521
He's patient with you,
and he's always there for you.

339
00:32:01,730 --> 00:32:06,193
He's just decent.

340
00:32:06,401 --> 00:32:09,863
And he always does the right thing.

341
00:32:10,072 --> 00:32:13,533
And that's how he teaches me to be.

342
00:32:13,742 --> 00:32:18,538
Would you say he's your hero?
-Oh, yeah. Yes, ma'am. Totally.

343
00:32:18,747 --> 00:32:21,375
My dad is my hero.

344
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,426
Does that put him to sleep?

345
00:32:32,344 --> 00:32:34,096
This one just relaxes him a little.

346
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:37,057
We're almost ready.
We'll be taking you in, in just a minute.

347
00:32:37,266 --> 00:32:38,892
Okay. Thank you.

348
00:32:42,813 --> 00:32:44,064
Well...

349
00:32:45,857 --> 00:32:49,194
Here we are.
-Yeah.

350
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:11,300
Relaxed yet?

351
00:33:11,508 --> 00:33:13,635
As a matter of fact...

352
00:33:17,556 --> 00:33:22,394
I don't know what this stuff is,
but it's pretty great.

353
00:33:24,396 --> 00:33:25,856
Yeah, it looks like it.

354
00:33:28,692 --> 00:33:30,777
We'll be here when you wake up.

355
00:33:31,737 --> 00:33:34,406
Well, I'll be looking for you.

356
00:33:34,615 --> 00:33:37,284
They'll probably want me
to take your glasses.

357
00:33:37,492 --> 00:33:39,202
Yeah, you better.

358
00:33:39,870 --> 00:33:43,749
Yeah, okay. Okay. I got them.

359
00:33:45,334 --> 00:33:47,294
Where's your phone?

360
00:33:47,502 --> 00:33:49,713
Your cell phone. Did you bring it?

361
00:33:49,922 --> 00:33:51,632
Which one?

362
00:33:55,135 --> 00:34:00,349
I'm pretty sure
he didn't bring it, Mom.

363
00:34:02,935 --> 00:34:04,311
Okay.

364
00:35:21,555 --> 00:35:23,015
Well, first things first.

365
00:35:23,223 --> 00:35:25,559
How old is that baby now?
When do I get to meet her?

366
00:35:25,767 --> 00:35:28,729
I was actually thinking
of bringing her today, but...

367
00:35:28,937 --> 00:35:31,148
She's 7 weeks tomorrow.

368
00:35:31,356 --> 00:35:32,357
Seven, right?
-Yeah.

369
00:35:32,566 --> 00:35:37,070
Yeah, oh, hey, I have a picture...

370
00:35:37,279 --> 00:35:39,114
...here somewhere.

371
00:35:40,657 --> 00:35:42,951
She's beautiful.
-Thanks.

372
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:45,871
Always a relief to say that
and actually mean it.

373
00:35:47,289 --> 00:35:50,876
How's your pain level, Walter?
-It's...

374
00:35:51,084 --> 00:35:53,086
Very low, basically.

375
00:35:53,295 --> 00:35:55,172
Shortness of breath?

376
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:58,133
A bit, but much better.
-Good.

377
00:35:59,301 --> 00:36:01,053
Well, your margins look good.

378
00:36:01,261 --> 00:36:02,763
I can't foresee the future...

379
00:36:02,971 --> 00:36:04,765
...but even
conservatively speaking...

380
00:36:04,973 --> 00:36:07,601
...I can say that you bought yourself
some real time here.

381
00:36:08,769 --> 00:36:11,188
There's no reason
not to be optimistic.

382
00:36:11,396 --> 00:36:13,190
That's great.

383
00:36:13,649 --> 00:36:16,985
That is great. Thank you, doctor.

384
00:36:18,362 --> 00:36:21,782
So when could he get back
to his normal routine?

385
00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:24,326
He can ease into it now.
-Okay.

386
00:36:24,534 --> 00:36:29,957
And can he go back to work or...?
-I'd give it a few more weeks.

387
00:36:30,499 --> 00:36:34,336
Make sure you avoid any heavy lifting
and continue to get plenty of rest.

388
00:36:34,544 --> 00:36:37,130
But he can be on his own?

389
00:36:37,339 --> 00:36:40,592
I mean, just more,
you know, independent.

390
00:36:41,051 --> 00:36:43,595
Yes. Use your best judgement.

391
00:36:44,429 --> 00:36:45,722
Well...

392
00:36:45,931 --> 00:36:48,517
Now, that's good news
for you, huh, honey?

393
00:36:48,725 --> 00:36:51,019
One less baby in the house.

394
00:37:02,406 --> 00:37:04,574
Don, hey.
-Hey, Stew.

395
00:37:04,783 --> 00:37:07,244
Hey, welcome back.

396
00:37:07,452 --> 00:37:09,413
Thanks. It's good to be back.

397
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:16,003
Jesus. We were all so sorry to hear.

398
00:37:16,795 --> 00:37:18,964
Yes. Thanks.

399
00:37:19,298 --> 00:37:21,383
Terrible thing. Just...

400
00:37:22,134 --> 00:37:25,304
But, you know, we've all been
thinking about you, and...

401
00:37:25,512 --> 00:37:28,181
You been doing okay?
-I'm doing okay.

402
00:37:28,599 --> 00:37:32,102
After a certain point,
time off doesn't help...

403
00:37:32,311 --> 00:37:35,856
...so I figured I'd rather be here.

404
00:37:36,398 --> 00:37:40,360
Focus on work.
-Sure. Absolutely.

405
00:37:40,986 --> 00:37:42,321
Yeah.

406
00:37:42,904 --> 00:37:45,324
Well, see you inside.

407
00:37:46,867 --> 00:37:50,329
Continue to descend through 1500.

408
00:37:50,537 --> 00:37:53,540
Headed downwind for a left base
on Runway 17.

409
00:37:53,749 --> 00:37:57,502
Number 26-Tango,
descend to maintain 13,000.

410
00:37:57,711 --> 00:38:01,465
Truth or Consequences altimeter,
two-niner-niner-eight.

411
00:38:01,673 --> 00:38:06,553
Pima 311, contact
Albuquerque Center 134.6.

412
00:38:06,762 --> 00:38:10,265
Juliet-5-Bravo, ident, say altitude.

413
00:38:10,933 --> 00:38:15,103
Juliet-5-Bravo, roger.
Clear direct to Winslow.

414
00:38:15,312 --> 00:38:17,898
I think I may just keep this.

415
00:38:18,148 --> 00:38:19,191
Sky?

416
00:38:20,859 --> 00:38:22,361
What do you think?

417
00:38:24,196 --> 00:38:26,239
Doesn't look so bad, right?

418
00:38:28,533 --> 00:38:29,743
What are you doing?

419
00:38:29,952 --> 00:38:32,496
I'm going to Hank and Marie's
for the weekend.

420
00:38:34,706 --> 00:38:36,583
Since when?
-I'm taking the baby with me.

421
00:38:36,792 --> 00:38:38,710
Marie will pick up
Walter Jr. from school.

422
00:38:39,461 --> 00:38:42,339
You'll have the house to yourself
for two days.

423
00:38:42,965 --> 00:38:45,509
I want you to pack your things
and leave.

424
00:38:46,468 --> 00:38:47,719
Why would I do that?

425
00:38:47,928 --> 00:38:51,098
Hank has offered to help. You shouldn't
be doing any heavy lifting.

426
00:38:51,306 --> 00:38:53,767
Skyler.
-I want you gone by Monday morning.

427
00:38:53,976 --> 00:38:55,394
I want-

428
00:38:55,811 --> 00:38:57,020
I want you gone.

429
00:39:06,822 --> 00:39:10,742
Okay. Can you at least tell me why?

430
00:39:11,743 --> 00:39:14,079
Because you're a liar, Walt.

431
00:39:16,248 --> 00:39:17,916
Two cell phones, after all.

432
00:39:19,376 --> 00:39:20,377
What?

433
00:39:20,586 --> 00:39:23,547
Before your surgery, I asked
if you had packed your cell phone...

434
00:39:23,755 --> 00:39:27,634
...and you said, "Which one?"

435
00:39:28,885 --> 00:39:30,095
When?

436
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:32,848
Skyler, I was medicated.

437
00:39:33,056 --> 00:39:35,225
I mean, I could have said
the world was flat.

438
00:39:35,434 --> 00:39:36,435
You know what I think?

439
00:39:38,353 --> 00:39:41,523
I think you accidentally
told the truth.

440
00:39:41,898 --> 00:39:44,610
Honey, we have been over this.

441
00:39:44,818 --> 00:39:46,778
Asked and answered, right?

442
00:39:46,987 --> 00:39:49,906
Then it got me thinking again...

443
00:39:50,115 --> 00:39:53,702
...about all the strange behaviour.

444
00:39:53,910 --> 00:39:56,371
Not the least of which
was the disappearance.

445
00:39:56,580 --> 00:39:59,041
Out of my mind with worry,
calling hospitals...

446
00:39:59,249 --> 00:40:01,168
...checking the morgue.

447
00:40:02,002 --> 00:40:04,171
Your fugue state?

448
00:40:06,757 --> 00:40:09,343
I had to believe that, didn't I?

449
00:40:09,843 --> 00:40:12,304
I had to find a way.

450
00:40:13,263 --> 00:40:18,185
I mean, who would lie
about such a thing?

451
00:40:18,894 --> 00:40:20,187
You tell me, Skyler.

452
00:40:20,395 --> 00:40:23,482
You tell me exactly what it is
you think I'm lying about.

453
00:40:23,982 --> 00:40:26,860
What? I'm having an affair.
Is that what you think?

454
00:40:27,069 --> 00:40:29,279
Yeah. For the last few weeks.

455
00:40:29,488 --> 00:40:32,157
With whom?
Who am I having an affair with?

456
00:40:32,366 --> 00:40:34,743
Well, my guess
was Gretchen Schwartz.

457
00:40:35,535 --> 00:40:39,289
Something was going on between you.
I just knew.

458
00:40:39,498 --> 00:40:43,043
Jesus. Skyler. Get me a Bible
to swear on, if that's what it takes.

459
00:40:43,252 --> 00:40:45,045
I am not having an affair
with Gretchen.

460
00:40:45,254 --> 00:40:48,298
I know. I know you're not.
Because I asked her.

461
00:40:52,094 --> 00:40:54,388
It really took me forever
to get in touch with her.

462
00:40:54,596 --> 00:40:56,515
She was ducking my calls for weeks.

463
00:40:57,474 --> 00:40:58,892
So I finally left a message:

464
00:40:59,101 --> 00:41:02,938
"What exactly is going on
between you and my husband?"

465
00:41:03,146 --> 00:41:05,565
I thought that'd get her attention,
and it did.

466
00:41:05,774 --> 00:41:09,361
So she called me back,
and she finally told me.

467
00:41:10,862 --> 00:41:13,240
The money for your treatment...

468
00:41:14,533 --> 00:41:18,453
...Gretchen and Elliott
didn't give you a dime.

469
00:41:20,122 --> 00:41:21,873
They paid for nothing.

470
00:41:22,082 --> 00:41:24,501
You refused every offer
they made you.

471
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:26,003
But that didn't make sense...

472
00:41:26,211 --> 00:41:28,672
...because I checked with Delcavoli
and the hospital...

473
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:32,175
...and not including your surgery...

474
00:41:32,384 --> 00:41:34,386
...we're nearly paid up.

475
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:37,431
Over $100,000.

476
00:41:38,890 --> 00:41:43,270
Out of where? Out of thin air?

477
00:41:51,737 --> 00:41:53,488
But then...

478
00:41:54,948 --> 00:41:57,159
...I called your mother.

479
00:41:59,244 --> 00:42:00,787
Yeah.

480
00:42:01,830 --> 00:42:03,665
Thanks for that too.

481
00:42:04,333 --> 00:42:06,668
But I thought, you know,
maybe she has some money...

482
00:42:06,877 --> 00:42:10,964
...that I don't know about.
Maybe she contributed.

483
00:42:12,341 --> 00:42:14,217
It's possible.

484
00:42:16,386 --> 00:42:20,849
It turns out that not only is the money
not from your mother...

485
00:42:21,058 --> 00:42:26,104
...she didn't even know
that you have cancer.

486
00:42:29,358 --> 00:42:31,652
You never went to see her.

487
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:35,405
I dropped you at the airport.
I picked you up.

488
00:42:35,614 --> 00:42:37,032
You were gone for four days...

489
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:41,036
...and yet she swears...

490
00:42:41,578 --> 00:42:43,872
...that you were never there.

491
00:42:48,627 --> 00:42:52,965
Lies on top of lies on top of lies.

492
00:42:54,883 --> 00:42:55,884
Skyler.

493
00:42:56,969 --> 00:42:58,762
Could you...

494
00:42:59,721 --> 00:43:01,682
...just once...

495
00:43:04,559 --> 00:43:08,272
...do me the courtesy
of not denying it?

496
00:43:17,447 --> 00:43:19,032
Skyler.

497
00:43:20,701 --> 00:43:22,369
Skyler, don't do this, please.

498
00:43:22,577 --> 00:43:24,830
I...

499
00:43:25,414 --> 00:43:27,958
Skyler, please don't go.

500
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:41,513
If I tell you the truth, will you stay?

501
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:46,435
Stay, and I will tell you everything.

502
00:43:47,769 --> 00:43:49,605
Whatever it is...

503
00:43:50,731 --> 00:43:52,691
...I'm afraid to know.
