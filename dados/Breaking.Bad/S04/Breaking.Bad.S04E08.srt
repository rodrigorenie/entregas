1
00:00:04,171 --> 00:00:05,922
- Are we done?
- Listen, I...

2
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:10,218
This attack on my brother-in-law,
I don't know what it means.

3
00:00:10,386 --> 00:00:12,178
Please.

4
00:00:13,097 --> 00:00:15,598
I fear for my family.

5
00:00:15,891 --> 00:00:18,309
I'm sure they'll be fine.

6
00:00:18,769 --> 00:00:22,313
I'm told the assassin that survived
is gravely injured.

7
00:00:22,481 --> 00:00:24,524
It's doubtful he'll live.

8
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:28,403
Now, thank me and shake my hand.

9
00:00:30,531 --> 00:00:34,909
- Thank you. Thank you again.
- You're quite welcome, Mr. White.

10
00:00:35,786 --> 00:00:37,954
Guys, guys, hurry up.

11
00:00:38,122 --> 00:00:41,124
- Can we go now?
- Upstairs, come on.

12
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:43,835
What's happening?

13
00:00:44,545 --> 00:00:45,837
Eight forty-three.

14
00:00:46,004 --> 00:00:49,215
Time of death, 20:43.

15
00:00:50,217 --> 00:00:52,552
Burn in hell, you piece of shit.

16
00:00:59,101 --> 00:01:01,352
One of the gunmen died
at the scene.

17
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,772
The second succumbed to his wounds
earlier this evening.

18
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:06,607
Agents with the DEA and FBI...

19
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:10,737
...in conjunction with APD are working
with Mexican law enforcement...

20
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:14,824
...in an attempt to identify
the deceased suspects. Both...

21
00:01:32,551 --> 00:01:34,886
I can give you the highlights.

22
00:01:35,763 --> 00:01:37,764
Your nephews grew impatient.

23
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:41,559
They continued to press me
for my permission to kill Walter White.

24
00:01:41,727 --> 00:01:46,397
When I wouldn't give it, they settled
instead for DEA Agent Schrader.

25
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:49,484
But a phone call was placed...

26
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:52,361
...to Agent Schrader
moments before the attack.

27
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:55,114
Thus giving him the upper hand.

28
00:01:55,282 --> 00:01:58,284
Marco was shot in the face
and died instantly.

29
00:01:58,452 --> 00:02:01,537
Leonel lingered for several hours.

30
00:02:02,748 --> 00:02:05,583
The warning call to the DEA agent...

31
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:09,462
...Juan Bolsa
may have some insight...

32
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,756
...into who placed it.

33
00:02:11,924 --> 00:02:14,175
Yesterday,
federales raided his hacienda.

34
00:02:14,343 --> 00:02:17,428
And in the confusion,
Juan was shot dead.

35
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:20,264
An accident, perhaps.

36
00:02:20,766 --> 00:02:24,018
A mistake made by his own men.

37
00:02:24,603 --> 00:02:26,687
Though we may never know.

38
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:30,566
At any rate,
I thought you should hear it from me.

39
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,413
This is what comes
of blood for blood, Hector.

40
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:39,552
So is this the loud one?

41
00:03:41,972 --> 00:03:43,222
What?

42
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:45,516
I can never remember.

43
00:03:45,684 --> 00:03:49,520
Is this the loud machine
with the magnets?

44
00:03:49,688 --> 00:03:52,356
No. This is the PET/CT scan.

45
00:03:52,524 --> 00:03:55,902
Positron emission tomography.

46
00:03:57,654 --> 00:04:04,660
They've paired that
with computed x-ray tomography.

47
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:08,998
Quiet. No magnets.

48
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:11,000
Right, okay.

49
00:04:11,168 --> 00:04:12,460
Yeah, thanks.

50
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:16,339
I'm still pretty new at this.

51
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:19,008
One minute,
I'm starting a new business...

52
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:21,385
...my wife and I
are thinking about kids.

53
00:04:21,553 --> 00:04:24,180
Walk into a doctor's office
and suddenly...

54
00:04:24,348 --> 00:04:27,683
- I mean, life as I know it...
- Excuse me.

55
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:31,312
Yes. I'm waiting
to hear a progress report...

56
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:35,191
...on the thing we discussed,
so call me.

57
00:04:38,904 --> 00:04:42,239
Anyway, so for me,
that's been the biggest wake-up call.

58
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:45,368
Letting go, giving up control.

59
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:49,580
You know, it's like they say,
"Man plans and God laughs."

60
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:54,543
That is such bullshit.

61
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:56,295
Excuse me?

62
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:59,006
Never give up control.

63
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:02,969
Live life on your own terms.

64
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,222
Yeah, no,
I get what you're saying...

65
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:08,557
...but cancer is cancer, so...

66
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:10,768
To hell with your cancer.

67
00:05:11,186 --> 00:05:14,021
I've been living with cancer
for the better part of a year.

68
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:18,109
From the start, it's a death sentence.
That's what they keep telling me.

69
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:19,986
Well, guess what?

70
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:23,489
Every life comes
with a death sentence.

71
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:28,035
So every few months,
I come in here for my regular scan...

72
00:05:28,203 --> 00:05:32,081
...knowing full well
that one of these times...

73
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:34,667
Hell, maybe even today.

74
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:38,546
...I'm gonna hear some bad news.

75
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:40,715
But until then...

76
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:43,009
...who's in charge?

77
00:05:43,385 --> 00:05:44,885
Me.

78
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:50,016
That's how I live my life.

79
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:10,619
This residue here is why we descale
with cool water...

80
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:13,330
...from the walk-in
and not water from the tap.

81
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:15,374
Do it again, please.

82
00:06:18,253 --> 00:06:21,630
Polios Hermanos, where something
delicious is always cooking.

83
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:25,009
Yes, detective.

84
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:50,659
Yeah.

85
00:06:52,454 --> 00:06:54,538
- Gustavo, thanks for coming.
- Pleasure.

86
00:06:54,706 --> 00:06:57,249
- How's Kathi?
- Much better, thank you.

87
00:06:57,417 --> 00:07:00,127
- And you know Hank Schrader?
- Yes, indeed.

88
00:07:00,295 --> 00:07:02,755
- And Steve Gomez?
- How was your meal?

89
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:06,175
Agent Schrader and I had a chance
to catch up at one of my restaurants.

90
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:09,720
I'd eat there every day
but I wouldn't fit through the door.

91
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:11,931
- Well, should we get started?
- Yeah.

92
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:17,019
- I'd like to record this conversation.
- Of course.

93
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:26,570
The DEA is working on an investigation
which may overlap with my own...

94
00:07:26,738 --> 00:07:28,489
...so I've asked them to sit in.

95
00:07:28,657 --> 00:07:32,326
Gus, we all appreciate your coming
in here to talk to us...

96
00:07:32,494 --> 00:07:35,412
...but you have the right
to have an attorney present.

97
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:38,833
Oh, well, I can't see
how that would be necessary.

98
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,043
But then,
I have no idea why I'm here.

99
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:42,837
So you wish to continue?

100
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:47,758
Please. I'm very anxious
to find out what this is all about.

101
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:51,595
Sir, your fingerprints were found
at a crime scene.

102
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:55,057
Really? That's surprising.

103
00:07:55,225 --> 00:07:57,893
A drug-related homicide.

104
00:08:03,525 --> 00:08:06,235
Gale Boetticher's apartment.

105
00:08:10,365 --> 00:08:12,074
So you knew the victim?

106
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:21,417
Fifteen years ago, I established
a chemistry scholarship at UNM.

107
00:08:21,585 --> 00:08:24,295
I named it
after Maximino Arciniega...

108
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:26,630
...a dear friend of mine
who died young.

109
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:29,383
Gale was a recipient
of this scholarship.

110
00:08:29,551 --> 00:08:33,721
He was perhaps one of three dozen.

111
00:08:33,889 --> 00:08:35,639
I see.

112
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:40,352
And Mr. Boetticher graduated in...

113
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,355
- 1999.
- That sounds right.

114
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:46,483
And you kept in contact with him
over all this time?

115
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:51,238
Oh, no. I hadn't seen Gale for years
until I ran into him a few weeks ago.

116
00:08:51,406 --> 00:08:54,450
- Ran into him where?
- At the restaurant.

117
00:08:55,327 --> 00:08:58,412
Well, "ran into" isn't quite accurate,
as I assumed...

118
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:02,583
...he came by to re-establish contact
with me. We caught up briefly.

119
00:09:02,751 --> 00:09:06,503
He invited me to dinner
the following night and I accepted.

120
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:12,051
It was perhaps a week later
when I read about him in the paper.

121
00:09:12,219 --> 00:09:15,054
- Drug related, you said?
- It's a good possibility.

122
00:09:15,222 --> 00:09:17,514
The paper made no mention of that.

123
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:20,392
I assumed
that it was a random crime.

124
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,772
So after years with no contact,
he shows up in your restaurant...

125
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:28,317
- ...and invites you to dinner?
- He wanted money.

126
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:31,445
- Gale Boetticher asked for money?
- He didn't say that.

127
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:36,575
He spoke in terms
of a vague investment opportunity.

128
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:40,788
But it was my suspicion, yes,
as to why he invited me into his home.

129
00:09:40,956 --> 00:09:46,293
He was a very, very talented chemist,
but for reasons I never understood...

130
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:49,546
...he was more interested
in taking shortcuts...

131
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:53,467
...than what would or could have been
a very promising career.

132
00:09:53,635 --> 00:09:55,803
Personal shortcomings
notwithstanding...

133
00:09:55,971 --> 00:09:58,180
...he was a warm, gentle person...

134
00:09:58,348 --> 00:10:00,766
...and I thought a lot of him.

135
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:06,939
At any rate,
I declined his business offer...

136
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:10,484
...and after
what was a very pleasant meal, left.

137
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:12,861
Can you tell us where you were...

138
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:16,657
...on the night of wednesday the 23rd
at around 8 p.m.?

139
00:10:16,825 --> 00:10:21,537
- Not an accusation, just a question.
- No, I understand. Let's see.

140
00:10:23,665 --> 00:10:25,332
Twenty-third.

141
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:29,378
I was at a fundraiser
at Presbyterian Hospital.

142
00:10:29,546 --> 00:10:32,256
I was there from 7 to about 10.

143
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:38,554
Anyone else?

144
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:44,351
Sorry, yeah. Just one other thing.

145
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:47,438
Is Gustavo Fring your real name?

146
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,442
Is it my real name?

147
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:55,321
I know you're a Chilean national...

148
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:58,699
...but there are no records of you
ever living there.

149
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:00,909
Really?

150
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:05,914
I mean, records show that you
immigrated to Mexico in 1986...

151
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:10,502
...and years later, you were granted
an entry visa to the United States.

152
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:16,759
But there's no record of Gustavo Fring
ever having existed in Chile...

153
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:19,970
...which I find, I don't know, strange.

154
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:22,556
Well, no, really, it isn't.

155
00:11:23,058 --> 00:11:25,809
Pinochet's government
was guilty of many sins.

156
00:11:25,977 --> 00:11:28,354
First and foremost
were human rights abuses.

157
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:32,441
But it was also notoriously unreliable
at keeping records.

158
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:36,653
I'm sure if you keep digging,
you'll find me.

159
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:42,117
Okay, I think that's it, Gus.
Thank you.

160
00:11:42,285 --> 00:11:44,870
I hope that I was of some small help.

161
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:48,624
- You were, absolutely. Thank you.
- You're very welcome.

162
00:11:48,792 --> 00:11:50,459
Good to see you again. Oh, no.

163
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:53,128
- No, please, please. Don't get up.
- Thanks.

164
00:11:58,385 --> 00:12:00,010
Gentlemen.

165
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:24,660
So are we buying?

166
00:12:24,828 --> 00:12:27,162
This thing with his name?
What are you thinking?

167
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:30,457
Sure, the record-keeping
in South America's hit or miss.

168
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:33,127
I mean, we run into that all the time,
right?

169
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:37,047
But we usually find something.
Before '86 this guy's a ghost.

170
00:12:37,215 --> 00:12:41,260
If State Department wasn't satisfied,
they wouldn't have naturalized him.

171
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:44,930
Well, maybe,
but he emigrated from Mexico in '89.

172
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:48,434
State just wasn't as tough
on background checks pre-9/11.

173
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:51,854
I don't know what this has to do
with the case at hand.

174
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:55,816
I was curious when his print showed up
at Boetticher's apartment.

175
00:12:55,984 --> 00:12:58,068
For me, the scholarship explains it.

176
00:12:58,236 --> 00:13:00,529
I'll admit to a certain degree of bias.

177
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:03,657
This man has been a longtime friend
of DEA.

178
00:13:03,825 --> 00:13:08,787
But that being said,
I thought his story was credible.

179
00:13:09,164 --> 00:13:11,748
Well, I agree.
I think it was a good story.

180
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:14,126
Still, why are we hearing it now?

181
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:15,335
What do you mean?

182
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:20,174
Well, like you said, he's a... This man
is a big law enforcement booster.

183
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:24,178
He's reading the newspaper and sees
that someone he had dinner with...

184
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:26,972
...someone he thought a lot of
was murdered.

185
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,975
He reads this
and he doesn't make a phone call?

186
00:13:30,393 --> 00:13:34,563
Didn't call you
or one of his other cop friends...

187
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:38,692
...to share his connection with the case
or ask about the investigation?

188
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:41,987
We can't predicate
a criminal investigation...

189
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:44,323
...on a person
not making phone calls.

190
00:13:46,117 --> 00:13:47,784
What do you think, Tim?

191
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:51,830
Well, I wanna follow up
on the scholarship, the alibi...

192
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:53,999
...but my overall impression?

193
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:55,375
I believed him.

194
00:14:05,595 --> 00:14:09,139
Nice touch. Birdbath.

195
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:13,101
- Hey, tiger, how's it hanging?
- Good.

196
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:18,106
Yeah, so very nice.

197
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:20,442
What's the damage?

198
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:23,654
Twelve hundred a month.
I did a lot of research.

199
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:27,491
- That's a pretty good deal.
- You kidding me? That's a great deal.

200
00:14:27,659 --> 00:14:29,576
Speaking of which...

201
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:31,995
...that's for the week.

202
00:14:32,163 --> 00:14:35,999
Plus there's a little extra in there
for any move-related incidentals.

203
00:14:36,167 --> 00:14:37,251
Thank you.

204
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:40,837
- Hey, champ, how's the new school?
- Good.

205
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:42,965
I loved school when I was your age.

206
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:46,802
Seesaws, story time,
chasing girls with sticks.

207
00:14:56,604 --> 00:15:01,275
It wasn't until the fifth grade
that I found out she liked me too...

208
00:15:01,651 --> 00:15:05,404
...but by then her family had moved
to Scottsdale, so...

209
00:15:07,699 --> 00:15:10,033
- Carpe diem, okay?
- Okay.

210
00:15:10,201 --> 00:15:11,743
All right. Good boy.

211
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:16,290
So you'll thank Jesse again
from both of us?

212
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:17,833
You got it.

213
00:15:19,294 --> 00:15:22,713
- So is he... How's he doing?
- Jesse?

214
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:33,015
He's good. He's busy.

215
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:42,816
How is it?

216
00:15:42,984 --> 00:15:47,863
Space, lots of light. it's...
Little garden out back. it's nice.

217
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:52,326
And Brock? How's he doing?

218
00:15:52,744 --> 00:15:55,912
Hey, look, I don't mind
dropping checks off every week...

219
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,539
...like Ed McMahon...

220
00:15:57,707 --> 00:16:00,125
...but if you wanna know
how they're doing...

221
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:03,086
...why don't you go see for yourself?

222
00:16:08,051 --> 00:16:09,468
I'll catch you later.

223
00:16:10,845 --> 00:16:13,472
- Hey, you gonna need a ride home?
- No.

224
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:00,185
Great.

225
00:17:04,399 --> 00:17:07,150
Anyway,
I'm proud for not losing my cool.

226
00:17:07,318 --> 00:17:10,195
Plus, it shows our crew
that I will support them...

227
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:12,239
...if a customer's being rude.

228
00:17:12,407 --> 00:17:15,867
You're really taking to this whole
be-your-own-boss thing.

229
00:17:16,327 --> 00:17:19,538
Yeah. I guess I am.

230
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:21,790
Actually...

231
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:26,002
...I'm thinking about making the move
up to management.

232
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:28,088
Jesus. Corporate America, look out.

233
00:17:28,256 --> 00:17:30,966
Excuse me,
I would be a vast improvement.

234
00:17:31,134 --> 00:17:35,095
No one in Kleinman's entire front office
knows about giving an x-ray...

235
00:17:35,263 --> 00:17:36,930
...which is just...

236
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:40,058
Hey, Dad, whatever happened
with your scan?

237
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:42,352
Did you get the results back?

238
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:46,732
Yeah, I did...

239
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:49,109
...and I'm still in remission.

240
00:17:49,277 --> 00:17:53,822
So you're all gonna have to be stuck
with me for a while longer.

241
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:55,073
Cheers, buddy.

242
00:17:57,452 --> 00:18:00,162
What about you, Hank?
How you feeling these days?

243
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:02,372
You know, getting there.

244
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:07,085
The other day, he had a big powwow
with all the DEA muckety-mucks.

245
00:18:07,962 --> 00:18:09,755
What was that about?

246
00:18:10,173 --> 00:18:13,008
Nothing. Just a dead-end.

247
00:18:13,176 --> 00:18:14,926
He won't tell me, either.

248
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:17,220
Apparently, it's all very hush-hush.

249
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:21,433
Hey, Walt, do me a favor?

250
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:25,937
Marie's working tomorrow
and there's a gem and mineral show...

251
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:30,609
...opening at the fairgrounds.
I wondered if you could give me a lift?

252
00:18:31,402 --> 00:18:33,653
Yeah. Sure.

253
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:36,490
I had a collection of my own
in high school.

254
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:40,285
I mean, nothing fancy.
Just entry-level beryls and garnets...

255
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:42,913
...one passable black tourmaline.

256
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,790
- Turn right here.
- Okay.

257
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:50,921
But I did have one piece of morganite
that was very special.

258
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:55,550
It'd been heat-treated,
so it had that classic cast to it.

259
00:18:55,718 --> 00:18:59,471
That rose, almost salmon hue,
you know?

260
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:02,265
Hey, Walt,
there's no rock show, okay?

261
00:19:02,725 --> 00:19:06,645
I just said that so Marie wouldn't freak.
Here. Take a right here.

262
00:19:10,775 --> 00:19:12,818
Freak about what?

263
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:16,404
Hank, where are we going?

264
00:19:21,452 --> 00:19:23,411
Are you hungry?

265
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:27,082
We're not here for the chicken.

266
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,835
Kill the engine.

267
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:35,173
All right.

268
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:38,343
You ready
for your mind to be blown?

269
00:19:39,053 --> 00:19:40,554
Sure.

270
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:44,641
Gustavo Fring, remember him?

271
00:19:44,934 --> 00:19:48,311
He came to the hospital
after the shooting. Put up the reward?

272
00:19:48,479 --> 00:19:52,941
He sponsors the DEA Fun Run
every year. You've met him?

273
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:58,321
Yeah, the Fun Run guy. Yeah.
That guy, yeah. What about him?

274
00:19:58,489 --> 00:20:02,993
Well, I suspect... I can't prove it,
mind you, but I suspect...

275
00:20:03,995 --> 00:20:06,204
...the man's a drug dealer.

276
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:11,334
Yeah. Methamphetamine.

277
00:20:11,502 --> 00:20:14,796
I mean, honest to God,
I really believe...

278
00:20:14,964 --> 00:20:18,633
...that this guy may be one
of the biggest movers in the southwest.

279
00:20:18,801 --> 00:20:20,176
Remember Gale Boetticher?

280
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:22,888
- That sad sack from the karaoke tape?
- Yeah.

281
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:27,017
And you said that he didn't strike you
as being the boss-man type?

282
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:29,227
That there was a bigger guy
out there.

283
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:33,899
- Hank, that was just speculation.
- Doesn't matter. it made me keep at it.

284
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,984
And guess what I find?

285
00:20:36,152 --> 00:20:40,739
Chicken Man's fingerprints
at Boetticher's murder scene.

286
00:20:41,157 --> 00:20:44,868
- So we bring him in...
- You think that Gustavo Fring...

287
00:20:45,036 --> 00:20:46,578
...killed Gale Boetticher?

288
00:20:46,913 --> 00:20:47,996
Probably not.

289
00:20:48,164 --> 00:20:51,333
These guys usually get a dunce
to pull the trigger, right?

290
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,419
But his fingerprints being there
was enough to bring him in. So I...

291
00:20:54,629 --> 00:20:56,630
So you brought him in to the police?

292
00:20:57,423 --> 00:21:00,592
Right. He sits down to talk with us,
the problem is that...

293
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,802
What did you ask him?
What did he say?

294
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:05,347
Walt,
will you let me finish my story here?

295
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:09,476
Sorry, I'm just
interested, you know?

296
00:21:09,644 --> 00:21:14,648
All right. whatever. So we bring him in
and he proceeds to kick our asses.

297
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:17,817
Okay? He's got an explanation
for the fingerprints.

298
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:21,821
He's got an alibi for Gale's murder.
He's got reasons for everything.

299
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:25,367
This guy
is Terms of Endearment convincing.

300
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:27,452
So he's not guilty?

301
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:30,664
Yeah. As far as DEA
and APD are concerned, he's not.

302
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:33,875
Officially, Fring's not a suspect.

303
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:36,044
But I'm telling you...

304
00:21:36,504 --> 00:21:39,881
...something deep down says
he's my guy.

305
00:21:40,216 --> 00:21:42,217
Just gotta prove it.

306
00:21:44,887 --> 00:21:48,431
Hank, why are you telling me this?

307
00:21:50,393 --> 00:21:52,435
I need a favor.

308
00:21:53,604 --> 00:21:54,813
What favor?

309
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:59,484
You see that Volvo station wagon
over there?

310
00:22:00,236 --> 00:22:03,029
The guy drives a 10-year-old Volvo.
It's brilliant.

311
00:22:03,406 --> 00:22:05,281
Anyway, listen...

312
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:08,827
...what I need for you to do...

313
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:12,122
...stick this on it.

314
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:17,043
GPS tracker.

315
00:22:17,211 --> 00:22:21,631
Wifey thinks hubby's screwing around
on her but she wants to be sure?

316
00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:25,093
Stick this on the car...
This part here, it's a magnet.

317
00:22:25,261 --> 00:22:26,928
...and see where he goes.

318
00:22:27,096 --> 00:22:28,263
Cool, huh?

319
00:22:28,431 --> 00:22:31,182
Two eighty-nine from SkyMall.

320
00:22:31,726 --> 00:22:34,519
It's not live-view,
so we gotta come back later...

321
00:22:34,687 --> 00:22:37,439
...and take it off
and stick it in the computer.

322
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:40,608
Still, a pretty amazing time
we're living in.

323
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:42,152
Hank, isn't that illegal?

324
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:46,448
I mean, isn't there some sort
of unlawful search and something...

325
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:52,370
it's known as extralegal.
But trust me, it's our little secret.

326
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:57,208
Look, it's easy, okay?
Here's what you do.

327
00:22:57,376 --> 00:23:00,754
You untie your shoelace
and you head toward the restaurant.

328
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:02,589
You're walking past the car...

329
00:23:02,757 --> 00:23:05,675
...look down and, "Hey, darn,
my shoe's untied." Okay?

330
00:23:05,843 --> 00:23:09,012
Now, when you bend down
to tie your shoe...

331
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:11,306
...you stick this into the wheel well.

332
00:23:11,474 --> 00:23:16,102
- Then you go inside and I don't know...
- Hank, I don't feel good about this.

333
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:19,606
I know that this kind of thing
is outside your comfort zone...

334
00:23:19,774 --> 00:23:22,233
No, I mean it. This is a mistake.

335
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:25,445
Walt,
I need you to help me out here, okay?

336
00:23:25,613 --> 00:23:27,363
This is really important to me.

337
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:30,867
Are you gonna make me beg?
Come on. Just stick it in there.

338
00:23:38,042 --> 00:23:39,375
Yeah.

339
00:23:40,044 --> 00:23:42,087
Just act normal.

340
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:26,297
May I help you?

341
00:24:30,094 --> 00:24:31,427
L... l...

342
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:34,264
Sir, may I help you?

343
00:24:39,103 --> 00:24:41,646
I didn't do it. See?

344
00:24:41,814 --> 00:24:44,399
- I didn't do it.
- Do it.

345
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:49,612
Do it.

346
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:52,073
May I help you with your order?

347
00:25:10,801 --> 00:25:12,302
What the hell is he...?

348
00:25:20,102 --> 00:25:24,230
Just made sure it was secure.

349
00:25:24,982 --> 00:25:27,066
Hey, where's my soda?

350
00:25:28,694 --> 00:25:32,197
Just kidding. Let's go. Let's go.

351
00:25:47,713 --> 00:25:49,589
Yes, that one.

352
00:26:04,021 --> 00:26:09,234
I swear to God, I thought I was driving
the man to a gem and mineral show.

353
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:12,528
All of a sudden he has me
pulling into your restaurant...

354
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:15,281
...and telling me
that he's investigating you.

355
00:26:15,449 --> 00:26:18,326
Look, you and I,
we've had our differences...

356
00:26:18,494 --> 00:26:20,453
...but I would never...

357
00:26:23,916 --> 00:26:29,170
Look, my brother-in-law,
evidence-wise, has nothing.

358
00:26:29,338 --> 00:26:31,673
He's operating on pure conjecture.

359
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,592
And no one, not one person
that he works with...

360
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:39,597
...thinks that you are anyone other
than an owner of a fast-food chain.

361
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:42,058
But if something were to happen
to Hank?

362
00:26:42,226 --> 00:26:46,896
That would only draw their attention
to you and therefore, to me, as well.

363
00:26:47,231 --> 00:26:51,526
We have a mutual interest
in resolving this without violence.

364
00:26:52,569 --> 00:26:57,448
I will make sure
that he discovers nothing.

365
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:08,084
Jesse!

366
00:27:08,669 --> 00:27:11,838
What? Oh, hey.
Don't wait to be, like, invited.

367
00:27:14,008 --> 00:27:15,842
Are we alone?

368
00:27:18,721 --> 00:27:21,597
- So where do we stand?
- Where do we stand on what?

369
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:25,727
Where do we stand with the thing
that you were supposed to do?

370
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:27,478
I assume you haven't done it.

371
00:27:28,605 --> 00:27:32,358
You didn't lose it, did you?
You would tell me if you lost it, right?

372
00:27:32,526 --> 00:27:34,193
Oh, Jesus.

373
00:27:34,903 --> 00:27:38,531
Asshole. You're creaming
to get it done, go do it yourself.

374
00:27:38,699 --> 00:27:42,035
If he didn't see me coming
like he's some kind of...

375
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:45,705
All right, look.
Our timetable has advanced.

376
00:27:46,123 --> 00:27:49,625
You have got to make this meeting
happen this week.

377
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:51,753
Tomorrow. Tonight, if possible.

378
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:55,882
Oh, tonight. What are you, high?

379
00:27:56,050 --> 00:28:01,054
My brother-in-law,
my DEA agent brother-in-law?

380
00:28:01,347 --> 00:28:03,598
He's onto Gus.

381
00:28:09,313 --> 00:28:12,857
Did you hear what I just said?
My brother-in-law is onto Gus.

382
00:28:13,025 --> 00:28:17,236
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I got it,
your brother-in-law. Okay, I'm thinking.

383
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:26,913
Look. So, what if this is
like math or algebra?

384
00:28:27,081 --> 00:28:31,417
We add a plus douche bag
to a minus douche bag...

385
00:28:31,585 --> 00:28:34,128
...and you get, like,
zero douche bags.

386
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:37,507
I've got some math for you.

387
00:28:37,674 --> 00:28:41,302
Hank catching Gus
equals Hank catching us.

388
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:47,016
Hank, he's relentless, all right?
He won't quit.

389
00:28:47,184 --> 00:28:50,269
Yeah, well, he's got nothing,
is all I can say.

390
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:53,648
- How would you know that?
- Because he's still above ground.

391
00:28:53,816 --> 00:28:58,611
Think a dude like Gus would let
your boy anywhere near him?

392
00:28:58,779 --> 00:29:01,781
He'll break out his box cutter
on his sorry gimp ass.

393
00:29:02,783 --> 00:29:07,703
So you haven't even seen him
since that time at the diner?

394
00:29:12,251 --> 00:29:13,918
Okay.

395
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:19,549
Think. All right.

396
00:29:24,138 --> 00:29:26,597
They've got to be figuring
that we've talked.

397
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:31,853
So you need to tell Mike that you
are worried about Hank's investigation.

398
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:35,398
Okay? Hank already knows
who you are, by the way.

399
00:29:35,566 --> 00:29:40,486
And besides, you actually did kill Gale,
so there's that.

400
00:29:40,654 --> 00:29:44,699
This is all good fodder for you
to request a sit-down with Gus...

401
00:29:44,867 --> 00:29:48,327
...so you can discuss
what you would say for questioning.

402
00:29:48,495 --> 00:29:51,622
Okay? Now, you just say
that you want to be...

403
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:55,793
No, that you need to be able
to be properly coached.

404
00:29:55,961 --> 00:29:58,087
Then, when you're near him...

405
00:29:58,422 --> 00:29:59,797
...you put this to use.

406
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:04,218
Mike's just gonna tell me
to shut my mouth if I get busted.

407
00:30:04,386 --> 00:30:08,181
- He ain't gonna set up no meeting.
- Well, then insist on it, damn it!

408
00:30:08,432 --> 00:30:10,141
Act panicked.

409
00:30:10,309 --> 00:30:12,310
Gus' ass is on the line.

410
00:30:12,478 --> 00:30:15,313
He'll meet with you
if he thinks you're a liability.

411
00:30:15,481 --> 00:30:19,484
No. He will waste me
if he thinks I'm a liability.

412
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:21,235
You know what?

413
00:30:21,403 --> 00:30:23,112
Whatever, man.

414
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,489
I'm gonna take a piss.

415
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:16,791
I think you got a phone call.

416
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:25,550
Anything important?

417
00:31:55,497 --> 00:31:58,165
- Yes?
- I did some digging around.

418
00:31:58,333 --> 00:32:00,918
- And?
- Neither the DEA...

419
00:32:01,086 --> 00:32:04,171
...nor the APD considers you
a person of interest.

420
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:07,216
Schrader is looking into you
totally on his lonesome.

421
00:32:07,384 --> 00:32:10,219
- A voice in the wilderness.
- Does he have resources?

422
00:32:10,387 --> 00:32:13,723
Just him, his credit card
and his chauffeur Walter.

423
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:18,394
He'd be committing career suicide if he
were to mention you to Merkert again.

424
00:32:18,562 --> 00:32:22,106
- No warrant for that tracking device?
- No.

425
00:32:22,274 --> 00:32:26,193
The guy has gone totally maverick.
He's Miss Daisy with binoculars.

426
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:29,238
We watch our backs,
we don't throw him any bones.

427
00:32:29,406 --> 00:32:30,823
He'll never make a case.

428
00:32:31,283 --> 00:32:34,994
- What about Chile?
- If I can't find any trace before '89...

429
00:32:35,162 --> 00:32:37,580
...I seriously doubt Schrader can.

430
00:32:37,748 --> 00:32:40,708
Seems to me
the bigger problem is the cartel.

431
00:32:40,876 --> 00:32:44,712
Now, we can handle them
if that's all we've got on our plate.

432
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:49,759
But dealing with both Schrader
and the Mexicans at the same time?

433
00:32:50,177 --> 00:32:54,221
If he happens to be watching
when they make a move...

434
00:32:54,556 --> 00:32:57,350
...it could be the perfect storm.

435
00:32:57,726 --> 00:32:59,101
Thank you.

436
00:32:59,269 --> 00:33:01,228
I'll be in touch.

437
00:33:32,177 --> 00:33:35,388
I don't know how many grandmas
and grandpas we got.

438
00:33:35,555 --> 00:33:37,807
Is there a couple of them
in viewing land?

439
00:33:37,974 --> 00:33:41,644
Well, it's "The Grandparent's Polka."

440
00:33:50,904 --> 00:33:52,780
Hello, Hector.

441
00:33:56,910 --> 00:34:00,788
The cartel has given me
its ultimatum.

442
00:34:00,956 --> 00:34:03,124
To which I've said no.

443
00:34:06,128 --> 00:34:10,798
DEA Agent Schrader, he's a concern.

444
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:15,970
He's looking into my past.

445
00:34:29,568 --> 00:34:32,737
Is today the day, Hector?

446
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:42,204
Gustavo, sit down.
You're making me nervous.

447
00:34:47,127 --> 00:34:49,628
It's a good plan. Trust yourself.

448
00:34:49,796 --> 00:34:51,630
Everything is going to be okay.

449
00:35:12,736 --> 00:35:14,278
Are you crazy?

450
00:35:14,821 --> 00:35:16,864
The boss is gonna rip your balls off!

451
00:35:17,282 --> 00:35:19,241
What, you gonna tell?

452
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,452
And you?

453
00:35:21,912 --> 00:35:23,996
They ain't gonna say nothing.

454
00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:26,457
They like what they see.

455
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:44,350
You're not going to offer
our guests anything?

456
00:35:44,643 --> 00:35:46,936
Who says they're guests?

457
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:50,898
If the boss wants them to drink...

458
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:53,526
...they drink.

459
00:35:57,823 --> 00:36:00,825
So... the Chicken Brothers.

460
00:36:02,619 --> 00:36:04,495
I like your restaurant.

461
00:36:07,874 --> 00:36:10,668
Dark meat and white meat?

462
00:36:11,044 --> 00:36:13,420
Don't look like no brothers to me.

463
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:18,133
At last!

464
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:19,927
The master chefs!

465
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:22,721
You two...

466
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:26,767
That chicken you cook...

467
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:31,689
I swear, it has got to be the tastiest
chicken in all of Mexico.

468
00:36:32,357 --> 00:36:33,399
Thank you, Don Eladio.

469
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,150
It's a great honor.

470
00:36:35,527 --> 00:36:36,569
Max is the chef.

471
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:38,445
The compliments are all his.

472
00:36:38,905 --> 00:36:40,155
Gustavo is too modest.

473
00:36:40,365 --> 00:36:42,283
There'd be no restaurant without him.

474
00:36:42,742 --> 00:36:45,744
Well, however you two do it, keep it up.

475
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:50,249
Your chicken, it's so... zesty.

476
00:36:51,084 --> 00:36:52,585
Piquant.

477
00:36:52,836 --> 00:36:55,754
But it does not taste
like a Mexican style.

478
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:58,048
It's a recipe I learned in Chile...

479
00:36:58,216 --> 00:37:01,051
...which I've modified a bit
for the Mexican palate.

480
00:37:01,303 --> 00:37:05,973
I bet we like a little more chili
than you Chileans.

481
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:10,978
We Mexicans like a good hard kick!

482
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:21,447
So... if your partner is the chef...

483
00:37:22,532 --> 00:37:23,949
...then who are you?

484
00:37:24,534 --> 00:37:27,494
Don't tell me you are just the taster!

485
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:32,124
I handle the business operations.

486
00:37:33,418 --> 00:37:36,086
Gustavo is a brilliant businessman.

487
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:38,088
Es el businessman.

488
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:39,924
Good, good.

489
00:37:41,551 --> 00:37:43,260
But tell me something.

490
00:37:44,721 --> 00:37:47,139
That chicken, so fabulous...

491
00:37:48,058 --> 00:37:50,100
...so excellent...

492
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:52,937
Besides that, what else
do you have on your menu?

493
00:37:53,855 --> 00:37:55,439
We have several side dishes.

494
00:37:55,857 --> 00:37:57,733
Rice. Beans.

495
00:37:58,151 --> 00:38:00,527
Sometimes we prepare
a carnitas entrée...

496
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:03,530
...if we come across fresh beef
in the market.

497
00:38:04,824 --> 00:38:05,866
Anything else?

498
00:38:07,077 --> 00:38:08,535
Come on, be honest.

499
00:38:09,329 --> 00:38:13,499
There is nothing else you offer?
A little taste of something else?

500
00:38:13,667 --> 00:38:16,460
Something on the side?

501
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:21,465
Because when I send my men
to your restaurant...

502
00:38:22,509 --> 00:38:25,761
...they come back
with more than just chicken.

503
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:28,555
They come back with drugs.

504
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,434
Regresan high.

505
00:38:34,187 --> 00:38:36,855
You are selling them narcotics.

506
00:38:37,107 --> 00:38:39,858
Methamphetamine.

507
00:38:42,112 --> 00:38:44,154
With all due respect, Don Eladio.

508
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:45,864
I didn't sell it to them.

509
00:38:46,032 --> 00:38:47,866
I gave them samples.

510
00:38:48,827 --> 00:38:50,285
Samples.

511
00:38:52,247 --> 00:38:54,707
Some businessman.

512
00:38:55,291 --> 00:38:58,460
I gave them samples to give to you.

513
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:01,672
To introduce you to our product.

514
00:39:01,923 --> 00:39:04,008
Don Eladio, Gustavo meant no offense.

515
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:07,261
But he... that is to say we...

516
00:39:07,512 --> 00:39:10,514
...could think of no other way
to get your attention.

517
00:39:11,683 --> 00:39:13,767
We want to work with you, Don Eladio.

518
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:18,522
I know all about methamphetamine.

519
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:24,278
That's poor man's cocaine.

520
00:39:25,822 --> 00:39:31,160
Only bikers and hillbillies use it.

521
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:35,205
There's no money in it.

522
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:37,082
May I, Don Eladio...

523
00:39:37,459 --> 00:39:39,501
I am a biochemist by training.

524
00:39:39,711 --> 00:39:42,254
The methamphetamine we make
is much superior...

525
00:39:42,505 --> 00:39:45,758
...to the so-called biker crank
you know of.

526
00:39:46,092 --> 00:39:47,718
It is crystallized, like glass.

527
00:39:48,261 --> 00:39:49,303
Purer.

528
00:39:49,471 --> 00:39:51,638
And the chirality of the molecule...

529
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:54,183
...its very structure, is different.

530
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:56,310
The narcotic effect is far more potent.

531
00:39:56,561 --> 00:39:59,646
This product is the drug of the future.

532
00:40:00,732 --> 00:40:02,608
It'll triple your profits.

533
00:40:03,735 --> 00:40:04,902
Perhaps quadruple.

534
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:08,781
They're not only good cooks...

535
00:40:08,948 --> 00:40:10,949
...they're great at shoveling manure.

536
00:40:18,792 --> 00:40:22,377
Right now, you deal almost exclusively
with cocaine.

537
00:40:22,629 --> 00:40:24,671
But the coca plant can't grow
in Mexico.

538
00:40:25,381 --> 00:40:27,925
You are no more than middlemen...

539
00:40:28,093 --> 00:40:30,094
...for the Colombians.

540
00:40:30,553 --> 00:40:34,848
They cut you a percentage for
smuggling across the border.

541
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:40,979
But the lion's share
of the profits goes to them...

542
00:40:42,065 --> 00:40:45,984
...despite your assumption
of all the risk.

543
00:40:46,736 --> 00:40:48,737
This new crystal methamphetamine...

544
00:40:48,905 --> 00:40:53,826
it's stronger,
more addictive than cocaine...

545
00:40:54,369 --> 00:40:57,412
...which means
it will move in higher volume.

546
00:40:57,580 --> 00:41:00,582
But most importantly,
it's completely artificial.

547
00:41:00,959 --> 00:41:03,085
We can show you
how to manufacture it...

548
00:41:03,253 --> 00:41:04,419
...right here in Mexico.

549
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:07,840
And you keep all the profits.

550
00:41:11,594 --> 00:41:14,638
My men do like your product.

551
00:41:18,017 --> 00:41:21,270
Hector, what is wrong with you?

552
00:41:21,437 --> 00:41:24,898
Why did you not get glasses
for our guests?

553
00:41:25,984 --> 00:41:27,985
Go on.

554
00:41:32,157 --> 00:41:35,200
You are quite the talent.

555
00:41:36,035 --> 00:41:40,247
I bet you learned cooking
from your mama. isn't that true?

556
00:41:41,416 --> 00:41:46,253
But... what about the chemistry?

557
00:41:46,963 --> 00:41:49,548
I studied at the University of Santiago.

558
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:51,967
Gustavo paid for my education.

559
00:41:52,135 --> 00:41:53,218
Oh, really?

560
00:41:54,012 --> 00:41:59,099
I have degrees in both biochemistry
and chemical engineering.

561
00:41:59,434 --> 00:42:01,768
With minimal capital investment...

562
00:42:01,978 --> 00:42:04,396
...we can set up
a factory-grade laboratory for you.

563
00:42:04,564 --> 00:42:07,816
Train your own people
to manufacture large quantities...

564
00:42:07,984 --> 00:42:09,860
...of highly pure methamphetamine.

565
00:42:11,279 --> 00:42:12,321
Fantastic!

566
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:17,701
Tell me one thing, though.

567
00:42:18,286 --> 00:42:20,370
If you're the cook...

568
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:22,706
Why do I need him?

569
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:26,668
Señor?

570
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:29,129
You.

571
00:42:29,297 --> 00:42:30,881
Businessman.

572
00:42:31,049 --> 00:42:35,969
Why should I negotiate with someone
who doesn't respect me?

573
00:42:36,930 --> 00:42:41,558
Who insults me by dealing
under my nose without my permission?

574
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,604
Who manipulates me into a meeting...

575
00:42:47,273 --> 00:42:49,191
...in front of my own men?

576
00:42:50,276 --> 00:42:52,611
What do I need you for?

577
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:56,323
Don Eladio. Please.

578
00:42:56,491 --> 00:42:58,158
I didn't sell anything.

579
00:42:58,409 --> 00:43:00,535
I apologize if you are offended...

580
00:43:00,703 --> 00:43:03,914
...by my method
of obtaining this meeting.

581
00:43:04,249 --> 00:43:07,501
I merely took the initiative.

582
00:43:08,503 --> 00:43:12,506
I meant no insult.

583
00:43:12,924 --> 00:43:14,883
Don Eladio,
Gustavo didn't mean to offend.

584
00:43:15,176 --> 00:43:16,760
I know Gustavo like a brother.

585
00:43:16,928 --> 00:43:18,262
He's an honorable man.

586
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:21,181
The most loyal man I have ever known.

587
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:23,642
He rescued me
from the Santiago slums.

588
00:43:23,810 --> 00:43:25,435
He made me the man I am today!

589
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:28,397
Gustavo is a genius.
He will make you millions!

590
00:43:28,815 --> 00:43:32,109
Just find it in your heart to forgive him
this one small mistake.

591
00:43:32,944 --> 00:43:33,986
Please...

592
00:43:35,738 --> 00:43:36,780
He's my partner.

593
00:43:37,156 --> 00:43:39,741
I need him! I swear to God!

594
00:44:16,195 --> 00:44:17,237
Look at him.

595
00:44:17,405 --> 00:44:18,947
You did this to him.

596
00:44:19,782 --> 00:44:22,993
Now, look at him.

597
00:44:36,799 --> 00:44:38,300
Listen to me.

598
00:44:38,968 --> 00:44:43,597
The only reason you are alive
and he is not...

599
00:44:44,807 --> 00:44:48,101
...is because I know who you are.

600
00:44:48,853 --> 00:44:49,978
But understand...

601
00:44:50,646 --> 00:44:52,647
You are not in Chile anymore.

602
00:45:04,952 --> 00:45:06,244
My advice...

603
00:45:07,622 --> 00:45:09,539
Stick to chicken.

604
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:48,703
Look at me, Hector.

605
00:45:54,919 --> 00:45:59,506
Look at me.

606
00:46:21,529 --> 00:46:23,572
Maybe next time.
