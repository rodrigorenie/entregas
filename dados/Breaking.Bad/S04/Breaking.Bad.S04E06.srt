1
00:00:50,342 --> 00:00:52,135
No, no, no!

2
00:02:13,342 --> 00:02:14,842
Hey.

3
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:46,601
It's me.

4
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:50,021
I wanted to say that I was thinking
about you and the kids.

5
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:56,319
I love you.

6
00:03:59,865 --> 00:04:01,866
It's me.

7
00:04:02,034 --> 00:04:07,204
I just wanted to say that I was thinking
about you and the kids, and...

8
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:30,937
- Morning.
- Afternoon.

9
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:34,440
Oh, really? Jesus.

10
00:04:34,942 --> 00:04:37,568
You shouldn't have let me sleep.

11
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:39,737
You needed it.

12
00:04:52,167 --> 00:04:55,378
Skyler, I don't entirely remember
what happened last night.

13
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:58,589
I mean, I might have said
some things that...

14
00:04:58,757 --> 00:05:01,592
Did you know
this Gale Boetticher person?

15
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:07,223
- Skyler, I can't even focus on...
- Gale Boetticher.

16
00:05:07,933 --> 00:05:09,809
Did you know him?

17
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:12,353
My God. What...?

18
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:15,523
What exactly did I say last night?

19
00:05:15,691 --> 00:05:17,650
Just enough.

20
00:05:18,694 --> 00:05:20,903
Did you work together?

21
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,036
Who killed him?

22
00:05:29,997 --> 00:05:32,581
Was it the people you work for?

23
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:35,793
Definitely not.

24
00:05:35,961 --> 00:05:37,378
Was it somebody who...

25
00:05:38,964 --> 00:05:43,843
...at some point,
might wanna do the same to you?

26
00:05:46,972 --> 00:05:51,225
I seriously doubt it. No.

27
00:05:55,105 --> 00:05:56,731
God.

28
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:02,028
Oh, God.

29
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:11,787
I think I know what happened
last night, Walt.

30
00:06:11,955 --> 00:06:15,833
I know exactly what happened
last night. I drank too much wine.

31
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:19,378
You told Hank...

32
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:23,174
...that the man he was looking for
might still be out there.

33
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:28,012
That it might not be this Boetticher
after all.

34
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:34,018
And I was up all night, wondering
why you would say that to him.

35
00:06:34,186 --> 00:06:35,728
Because I was drunk, Skyler.

36
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:40,107
No, but then I was remembering
your black eye.

37
00:06:40,275 --> 00:06:44,153
Your business disagreement
that you don't wanna talk about.

38
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:48,449
Look, I don't want to talk
about any of this. Ever.

39
00:06:48,617 --> 00:06:51,035
The firewall, all right?

40
00:06:51,203 --> 00:06:53,162
Church and state.

41
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:56,123
That's how we need to approach
this thing.

42
00:06:59,044 --> 00:07:02,671
And then I remembered the message
you left me the other day...

43
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:06,217
...when you said you loved me.

44
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:12,264
When I heard that,
I thought that maybe you...

45
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:16,852
I don't know, that you were regretting
what's happened between us.

46
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:18,312
And I get that.

47
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:21,107
After last night, I...

48
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:28,531
Walt, I think you're scared.

49
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:32,451
I think that message
was some kind of goodbye.

50
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:34,370
No, Skyler.

51
00:07:34,538 --> 00:07:37,748
- I think last night was a cry for help.
- Oh, Jesus.

52
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:39,333
A cry for help?

53
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:42,336
I think some part of you
wants Hank to catch you.

54
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:47,049
That is just...

55
00:07:47,217 --> 00:07:52,346
That is it exactly. Yes.

56
00:07:52,514 --> 00:07:54,682
You're like Dr. Joyce Brothers here.

57
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:55,933
God.

58
00:07:56,101 --> 00:07:57,893
At least this would all be over.

59
00:07:58,061 --> 00:08:02,523
Yeah, yeah, oh, there's a tremendous
weight just lifted off of me.

60
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:04,859
Now I understand myself.

61
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:06,652
Thank you. Thank you.

62
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,530
Walt, I've said it before.

63
00:08:09,698 --> 00:08:13,033
If you are in danger,
we go to the police.

64
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:18,622
- I don't wanna hear about the police.
- I do not say that lightly.

65
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:20,916
I know what it could do
to this family.

66
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:26,422
But if it's the only real choice we have,
if it's either that or you getting shot...

67
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:28,591
I don't wanna hear about the police.

68
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:33,012
You're not some hardened criminal,
Walt. You are in over your head.

69
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:35,472
That's what we'll tell them, the truth.

70
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,267
- That is not the truth.
- Of course it is.

71
00:08:38,435 --> 00:08:41,770
A schoolteacher, cancer,
desperate for money...

72
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:45,149
- We're done here.
- Roped into working... Unable to quit.

73
00:08:45,317 --> 00:08:47,401
You told me that yourself, Walt.

74
00:08:47,903 --> 00:08:51,488
Jesus, what was I thinking?
Walt, please.

75
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:55,451
Let's both of us stop trying
to justify this whole thing...

76
00:08:55,619 --> 00:08:57,328
...and admit you're in danger.

77
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:02,416
Who are you talking to right now?

78
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:07,338
Who is it you think you see?

79
00:09:09,216 --> 00:09:11,800
Do you know
how much I make a year?

80
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:14,803
I mean, even if I told you,
you wouldn't believe it.

81
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:18,515
You know what would happen
if I decided to stop going in to work?

82
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:23,020
A business big enough that it could be
listed on the NASDAQ goes belly up.

83
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:26,899
Disappears. it ceases to exist
without me. No.

84
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:31,153
You clearly don't know who you're
talking to, so let me clue you in.

85
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:35,324
I am not in danger, Skyler.
I am the danger.

86
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:39,620
A guy opens his door and gets shot,
and you think that of me? No.

87
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:42,831
I am the one who knocks.

88
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:25,374
Look, I was...

89
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,057
Skyler?

90
00:11:03,538 --> 00:11:06,999
Here we are. Just like you left it.

91
00:11:09,294 --> 00:11:11,712
And where is your pretty wife?

92
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:15,466
She has other business to attend to.

93
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:22,181
Well, like I say to her,
place sells as is. Understand?

94
00:11:22,891 --> 00:11:24,933
Yes, I understand.

95
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:27,144
Good, good.

96
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:29,897
I don't want her coming back
with more demands.

97
00:11:30,065 --> 00:11:32,649
She gave me hard time
when we settled on price.

98
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:36,111
We're all on the same page, Bogdan.

99
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:40,366
So here is everything you need.

100
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:43,410
- I keep very good files.
- Thank you.

101
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:47,081
So you are the boss now, huh?

102
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:52,669
You think you're ready?

103
00:11:54,297 --> 00:11:57,091
Yes, I think so.

104
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:02,304
Being boss is tough.

105
00:12:03,098 --> 00:12:07,893
I know you think I was hard on you,
but you'll learn.

106
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:10,938
Being in charge is not easy.

107
00:12:11,523 --> 00:12:13,023
It takes hard work.

108
00:12:13,191 --> 00:12:16,568
- You've seen me work hard, Bogdan.
- Yeah?

109
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,821
I don't know.

110
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:20,948
Not so much, maybe.

111
00:12:21,116 --> 00:12:23,659
But maybe when you are the boss...

112
00:12:23,827 --> 00:12:27,830
...you will just keep your feet up
and relax.

113
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:33,210
The real important thing...

114
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:34,962
And not everyone knows this.

115
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:37,881
...Is to be tough.

116
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:43,262
Boss has to be tough.

117
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,432
Has to say no to people.

118
00:12:46,641 --> 00:12:52,980
Has to make cashiers
wipe down cars...

119
00:12:53,148 --> 00:12:56,900
...even if they don't want to.

120
00:12:58,653 --> 00:13:02,030
Can you be tough, waiter?

121
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:08,036
I am sure you can handle.

122
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:13,292
And if not,
you can always call your wife, no?

123
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:22,634
- Always sticky.
- Yeah.

124
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,428
No problem.

125
00:13:26,598 --> 00:13:28,599
As is.

126
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:48,619
Who'd have thought that someday
I would be handing these keys to you?

127
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:07,596
Many years. Almost forgot.

128
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:14,561
Bogdan.

129
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:19,525
As is.

130
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:35,851
Thank you.

131
00:16:11,554 --> 00:16:12,679
You okay there?

132
00:16:14,891 --> 00:16:16,725
I'm fine.

133
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:21,855
Just not using is...

134
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:33,158
Eat something.

135
00:17:07,235 --> 00:17:08,819
Yeah?

136
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:12,447
That's right, both of them.

137
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:14,866
All right.

138
00:17:15,827 --> 00:17:17,953
I'm on my way.

139
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:21,832
You need any help?

140
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:26,002
No.

141
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:47,983
You want me to call her back?

142
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:51,194
No. No.

143
00:17:53,114 --> 00:17:57,284
What exactly did she say?
I mean, exactly.

144
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:03,457
Just, you know, she asked if I was okay
and not to worry.

145
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:05,292
Like that.

146
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:12,382
Any rough timetable on this thing,
as to when she's coming home?

147
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:18,889
It's about the gambling, right?

148
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,518
Well, it's kind of hard to...

149
00:18:23,686 --> 00:18:25,771
Dad, she can't understand.

150
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:30,525
It's not like you're doing this
on purpose. You can't help it.

151
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:33,570
It's not that simple.

152
00:18:33,738 --> 00:18:38,992
Look, you have a disease.
It's like you're an alcoholic, right?

153
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:42,746
- No, it's not. Not at all.
- Yes, it is. I read online.

154
00:18:42,914 --> 00:18:45,665
She's not even allowed
to be mad at you.

155
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:48,585
She can't be mad at you
about the cancer, can she?

156
00:18:48,753 --> 00:18:51,213
Son, these are two
very different things.

157
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:54,758
Not really.
Gambling addiction is a sickness.

158
00:18:54,926 --> 00:18:57,594
- You can't...
- Listen, what is going on with me...

159
00:18:57,762 --> 00:19:00,430
...is not about some disease.
It's about choices.

160
00:19:00,598 --> 00:19:02,140
Choices that I have made.

161
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:05,018
Choices I stand by.

162
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:16,947
You're not moving back in, are you?

163
00:19:24,831 --> 00:19:26,248
No.

164
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:37,175
Hey, you know what?
School can wait.

165
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:41,847
Why don't we take a little detour?

166
00:19:42,557 --> 00:19:45,141
What kind of detour?

167
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,019
You'll see.

168
00:19:52,233 --> 00:19:55,610
Charlie, pick up line three.
Line three, Charlie.

169
00:19:58,573 --> 00:20:03,827
I think it's time we got you
your own car. What do you think?

170
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:06,621
What?

171
00:20:07,957 --> 00:20:12,085
I think if you're gonna buy me off...

172
00:20:12,587 --> 00:20:14,921
...buy me off.

173
00:20:16,841 --> 00:20:20,176
Get an attendant over to the lot.

174
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:42,949
- Amazing. it's amazing.
- Yeah. it's good-looking.

175
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,995
That's good. I'm glad you like it.

176
00:20:47,163 --> 00:20:50,832
- I do. Thank you, Dad.
- All right. You're welcome.

177
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:08,767
So you're here.

178
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:11,436
Yeah.

179
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:16,775
You're actually here? To work?

180
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:20,946
Yeah, man. Jesus.

181
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:22,530
Jesse.

182
00:21:23,908 --> 00:21:25,283
Come here.

183
00:21:25,451 --> 00:21:28,453
- All right, I need an update.
- Update on what?

184
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:33,041
An update on these little field trips
that you've been taking with Mike.

185
00:21:33,209 --> 00:21:38,004
I told you already. We pick up money.
Check on things. Stuff like that.

186
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:43,969
And you're his bodyguard, right?
What? That's what you said.

187
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:46,054
I said I guarded him.

188
00:21:46,222 --> 00:21:51,017
Like backup, like a second set of eyes.
Everybody needs backup, right?

189
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:53,269
And this has to be you?

190
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:59,067
It can't be, I don't know, Tyrus or any
of the couple dozen muscle-heads...

191
00:21:59,235 --> 00:22:03,279
...that Gus has working for him?
It has to be Jesse Pinkman.

192
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:07,534
Why? What, is there something
about you that I don't know?

193
00:22:07,702 --> 00:22:10,036
Are you a former Navy SEAL?

194
00:22:10,204 --> 00:22:12,580
Your hands registered
as lethal weapons?

195
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:13,832
Register this.

196
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,502
All I'm saying is that
do you not even question this?

197
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:21,006
Do you really believe that you mean
anything to these people?

198
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:24,259
Not trying to insult. Just trying to
make you see things.

199
00:22:24,427 --> 00:22:28,304
I see they can't outright kill me,
but they don't want me getting high.

200
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:32,851
I see this thing probably started
as Gus getting Mike to babysit me.

201
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:34,978
But you know what?

202
00:22:35,146 --> 00:22:40,025
I saved Mike from getting robbed,
even killed, maybe.

203
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:43,987
So maybe I'm not such a loser
after all.

204
00:22:46,574 --> 00:22:49,784
I mean, what if it...? Oh, God.

205
00:22:58,502 --> 00:23:01,963
- All right. what if it's all just a setup?
- What?

206
00:23:02,131 --> 00:23:06,384
What if this robbery that you stopped
wasn't even real?

207
00:23:06,552 --> 00:23:09,804
I mean, think about it.
Your first day out guarding Mike.

208
00:23:09,972 --> 00:23:12,390
He steps out for one second
and what happens?

209
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:15,643
- You immediately get robbed.
- You are such an asshole.

210
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:19,314
Keep your friends close,
your enemies closer. Like you said...

211
00:23:19,482 --> 00:23:23,151
...Gus can't kill you because of me,
he knows I won't stand for it.

212
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:25,361
He hates the fact that he needs me.

213
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:29,240
What does he do? He goes to work
driving a wedge between you and me.

214
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:32,118
If you'd been there,
you'd know it wasn't a setup.

215
00:23:32,286 --> 00:23:35,830
Wait a minute. How long
did those guys chase you, huh?

216
00:23:35,998 --> 00:23:39,876
Because the way you describe it,
they gave up pretty damn easy.

217
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:45,632
No, no, this whole thing, all of this...

218
00:23:47,218 --> 00:23:49,594
...it's all about me.

219
00:24:36,642 --> 00:24:38,184
Hello?

220
00:24:40,146 --> 00:24:42,689
Look, just hang on.

221
00:24:47,361 --> 00:24:48,736
Yeah?

222
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:51,114
I'll be right up.

223
00:24:53,534 --> 00:24:56,411
- What?
- I gotta go.

224
00:24:56,579 --> 00:25:00,290
What? Am I supposed to clean all this
on my own?

225
00:25:03,836 --> 00:25:05,628
Hey.

226
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:11,050
God...

227
00:25:29,737 --> 00:25:32,739
Buenos dias, ladies, buenos dias.

228
00:25:32,907 --> 00:25:34,490
Do you speak English?

229
00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:37,202
- No.
- No, okay.

230
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:41,080
Help, help.

231
00:25:49,465 --> 00:25:51,925
I need help to clean. Yes.

232
00:26:05,064 --> 00:26:08,149
- Yes, muy bueno. it's just this...
- No.

233
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:13,488
No, no, no.

234
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:22,914
No, no, ladies.

235
00:26:35,177 --> 00:26:39,222
Let me see, let me see. I tell you what.
I tell you what. Look, look.

236
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:41,140
Universal language.

237
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:48,314
This one for you. Yeah, sí.

238
00:26:48,482 --> 00:26:52,026
Sí, Presidente Grant.
Very important man.

239
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:58,992
Mas dinero after the...

240
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:03,079
Are we good?

241
00:27:03,247 --> 00:27:07,542
I think we're good. I think we listened
to you. Please, por favor, por favor.

242
00:27:10,212 --> 00:27:12,672
Please, por favor, por favor.

243
00:27:13,549 --> 00:27:15,508
Yes.

244
00:29:55,085 --> 00:29:56,210
What's the deal?

245
00:29:58,881 --> 00:30:03,843
Well, the deal is,
we're watching that house.

246
00:30:04,386 --> 00:30:07,138
Couple down on the left
with the tree in the front.

247
00:30:07,306 --> 00:30:09,182
Yeah? What for?

248
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:11,767
A little birdie told me
there's some guys...

249
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:15,188
...that have 3 pounds of our product
which they're selling.

250
00:30:15,355 --> 00:30:18,649
And which they sure as hell
didn't get from us.

251
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:22,695
So, what's the plan?

252
00:30:23,739 --> 00:30:25,323
I just told you.

253
00:30:25,491 --> 00:30:28,242
We sit here and watch that house...

254
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:31,245
...until one of our entrepreneurs
pops his head out.

255
00:30:31,413 --> 00:30:35,124
Then we ask a few questions
and get our property back.

256
00:30:36,502 --> 00:30:39,212
Why don't you just go
break the door down...

257
00:30:39,379 --> 00:30:42,340
...pistol-whip those bitches
and show them who's boss?

258
00:30:42,508 --> 00:30:47,053
Because a little birdie also told me
these guys are into the product...

259
00:30:47,221 --> 00:30:49,347
...and most likely armed.

260
00:30:49,515 --> 00:30:53,059
Now, what you may not know
about meth-heads...

261
00:30:53,435 --> 00:30:55,436
Or maybe you do.

262
00:30:55,604 --> 00:30:58,022
They're kind of unpredictable.

263
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:02,235
I don't care for unpredictable.
So we wait.

264
00:31:03,946 --> 00:31:08,115
Sorry to burst your bubble, kid,
but that's 90 percent of the job.

265
00:31:09,326 --> 00:31:13,287
Don't worry. I brought sandwiches.

266
00:31:16,083 --> 00:31:17,875
Yes, sir.

267
00:31:21,505 --> 00:31:24,924
Pimento cheese. How's that sound?

268
00:31:32,641 --> 00:31:33,808
Where you going?

269
00:31:34,017 --> 00:31:37,979
You said they're selling right?
Maybe I'm looking to buy.

270
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:47,071
Who the hell are you?

271
00:31:47,656 --> 00:31:49,615
- Tucker! Tucker!
- I'm here to buy.

272
00:31:49,783 --> 00:31:52,368
- Will you shut the damn door?
- Not my question.

273
00:31:52,536 --> 00:31:56,330
Name's Diesel. Heard you
maybe had some of the blue.

274
00:31:56,498 --> 00:31:59,208
- Tucker. Shut the door, Tucker! Tucker!
- I just...

275
00:31:59,376 --> 00:32:02,086
- Just looking for a teenth, yo.
- Tucker!

276
00:32:02,254 --> 00:32:04,380
- Come on, help a brother out.
- Tucker!

277
00:32:04,548 --> 00:32:08,050
- Will you shut the damn door?
- We don't sell to strangers.

278
00:32:08,218 --> 00:32:10,553
- Tucker!
- Get off the porch, asshole.

279
00:32:10,721 --> 00:32:13,222
- Will you shut the door?
- All right already!

280
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:15,349
Tucker!

281
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:51,093
Guess we'll go with Plan A, then.

282
00:33:05,859 --> 00:33:09,904
- Pop the trunk, would you?
- Why?

283
00:33:10,072 --> 00:33:13,324
- There's something in there I need.
- And what would that be?

284
00:33:13,492 --> 00:33:15,910
I'm getting those pricks
out of that house.

285
00:33:16,078 --> 00:33:18,996
Oh, your first attempt
being such a wild success?

286
00:33:19,164 --> 00:33:22,583
You may know this whole
Pl sit-in-the-car business...

287
00:33:22,751 --> 00:33:25,211
...but I know meth-heads.

288
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:18,389
What are you doing?

289
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:20,599
Digging.

290
00:34:21,643 --> 00:34:23,144
Why?

291
00:34:24,521 --> 00:34:26,522
You know why.

292
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:28,816
How deep are you going?

293
00:34:28,984 --> 00:34:32,820
I don't know.
How deep do you think it is?

294
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:38,200
Pretty deep.

295
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:50,337
Hey, you mind taking over
for a minute?

296
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:53,841
Yeah, sure.

297
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:08,522
- Hey, mind if I use your john?
- Yeah.

298
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:36,550
Tucker.

299
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:39,986
Tucker!

300
00:35:52,317 --> 00:35:54,401
Who the hell are you?

301
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:56,278
- I just...
- Who the hell are you?

302
00:35:56,446 --> 00:35:59,824
It's cool. Hey, I'm a friend of Tucker's.

303
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:05,663
- What do you want?
- I just wanna buy some of the blue.

304
00:36:05,831 --> 00:36:07,623
It's not for sale.

305
00:36:09,209 --> 00:36:11,418
I know you were selling it earlier...

306
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:15,631
- Oh, yeah? How do you know that?
- Tucker told me.

307
00:36:15,799 --> 00:36:18,884
Yeah, Tucker needs to learn
to keep his damn mouth shut.

308
00:36:19,052 --> 00:36:21,220
Tucker! Tucker!

309
00:36:22,722 --> 00:36:26,350
So you gonna hook me up?

310
00:36:26,518 --> 00:36:30,813
Don't have enough for all
of Tucker's asshole friends. Tucker!

311
00:36:31,231 --> 00:36:35,276
You know, I think he's outside.
You wanna just go outside...

312
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:40,698
- Tucker! Tucker!
- Hey, hey. Let's go find Tucker.

313
00:36:40,866 --> 00:36:42,616
Okay? Let's go outside.

314
00:36:42,784 --> 00:36:47,413
I don't have enough for you,
all right?

315
00:36:47,581 --> 00:36:52,668
Yeah. yeah. Yeah, I get it. Okay.

316
00:36:52,836 --> 00:36:57,131
- I don't wanna start any trouble.
- Trouble? What's that mean? Trouble?

317
00:36:57,299 --> 00:37:00,384
No, no, no.
I'm just saying we're cool, okay?

318
00:37:00,552 --> 00:37:01,802
- We're good.
- What?

319
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:04,305
You can't know that.
What does that mean?

320
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:08,767
You don't put thoughts in my head.
You don't put thoughts in my head.

321
00:37:08,935 --> 00:37:12,313
- Absolutely. You're right. You're right.
- Tucker?

322
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:19,236
You...

323
00:37:54,022 --> 00:37:56,023
Here you go, Maria.

324
00:37:56,191 --> 00:37:57,733
Veronica.

325
00:37:57,901 --> 00:38:00,069
Ilia, gracias.

326
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:10,120
I missed that one.
I'm sure it was good.

327
00:38:20,966 --> 00:38:23,050
Wait, where you taking them?

328
00:38:23,218 --> 00:38:27,388
- Come on, Tyrus, what are you doing?
- I'm putting them on a bus.

329
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:30,557
- Why? What bus?
- One that takes them back to Honduras.

330
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:33,268
Hey, wait a second. Wait a minute.

331
00:38:34,688 --> 00:38:38,107
Wait, wait. This was my idea.
Don't punish them.

332
00:38:38,274 --> 00:38:41,151
You tell Gus to blame me, not them.

333
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:43,654
He does.

334
00:39:08,013 --> 00:39:09,513
Give us a minute, will you?

335
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:24,028
We won't be too long.

336
00:39:32,287 --> 00:39:34,997
The crew that hit our truck
gave away the cargo...

337
00:39:35,165 --> 00:39:37,166
...to a couple local nobodies.

338
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:40,919
Very disciplined of them,
not keeping anything for themselves.

339
00:39:41,087 --> 00:39:43,881
It was all about sending a message.

340
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:46,842
Which they did, literally.

341
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:49,553
It was written on the bucket lid.

342
00:39:50,138 --> 00:39:51,972
"Ready to talk?"

343
00:39:52,182 --> 00:39:55,434
That, I believe,
is the English translation.

344
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:01,940
I know you're not really asking
for advice.

345
00:40:02,108 --> 00:40:07,821
But let me hire 10, 15 more
good operators.

346
00:40:07,989 --> 00:40:10,741
Then we hit them hard.
Hit them where they live.

347
00:40:11,451 --> 00:40:15,496
No. This war stays cold for now.

348
00:40:19,876 --> 00:40:22,377
What about their message?
What's the answer?

349
00:40:26,132 --> 00:40:30,219
Set up a meeting.
Let's see what they have to say.

350
00:40:32,305 --> 00:40:34,306
How did he do today?

351
00:40:56,579 --> 00:40:58,872
I hear you can handle yourself.

352
00:41:00,125 --> 00:41:01,792
I guess.

353
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:04,378
Good night.

354
00:41:04,963 --> 00:41:06,880
Hey, excuse me?

355
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:10,467
Why me?

356
00:41:12,137 --> 00:41:15,097
I like to think I see things in people.

357
00:41:40,665 --> 00:41:45,085
Slow down.
The car is not going anywhere.

358
00:41:48,047 --> 00:41:51,508
- Mom.
- Hey, sweetheart.

359
00:41:51,676 --> 00:41:54,511
- Hi.
- Hey.

360
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:00,976
- So did you see what's in the driveway?
- There you go.

361
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:03,896
Yeah, I saw.

362
00:42:04,272 --> 00:42:05,939
Hey.

363
00:42:08,401 --> 00:42:10,194
So that's yours, huh?

364
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:12,821
Yeah. Dad got it for me.

365
00:42:12,989 --> 00:42:15,324
Well, that was very nice of him.

366
00:42:16,034 --> 00:42:17,618
Yeah.

367
00:42:17,785 --> 00:42:20,954
I know it looks like...

368
00:42:21,456 --> 00:42:24,917
...well, awesome, but it's super safe.

369
00:42:25,084 --> 00:42:26,543
Dad made sure.

370
00:42:26,711 --> 00:42:30,047
And I promise
to always go the speed limit. Or below.

371
00:42:30,215 --> 00:42:31,381
Way below.

372
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:36,136
And it gets great gas mileage.

373
00:42:37,513 --> 00:42:42,267
So Dad said I can take it around
the block a few times. That okay?

374
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:44,895
Just around the block.

375
00:42:45,063 --> 00:42:48,106
Yeah. Just around the block.

376
00:42:48,650 --> 00:42:52,152
- And be careful, okay?
- I will.

377
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:54,446
Bye.

378
00:42:57,116 --> 00:43:00,869
It's really... it's really great
to have you home, Mom.

379
00:43:08,211 --> 00:43:10,879
Hey, seriously, be careful. Okay?

380
00:43:11,047 --> 00:43:12,965
- I will.
- Okay.

381
00:43:30,817 --> 00:43:33,068
I guess we should talk.

382
00:43:33,653 --> 00:43:36,405
Well, I think you said plenty
the other day.

383
00:43:36,572 --> 00:43:40,450
Look, about that, it just...

384
00:43:41,077 --> 00:43:43,704
Did you get the car wash keys?

385
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:48,500
Yes. Yes. Here.

386
00:43:54,924 --> 00:44:01,221
Skyler, I may have
overstated things earlier...

387
00:44:01,389 --> 00:44:05,559
...and I'm sorry to be so forward.

388
00:44:06,269 --> 00:44:10,063
But I just...
l want you to know something.

389
00:44:10,231 --> 00:44:11,898
I want you to...

390
00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:14,776
I need you to understand...

391
00:44:15,069 --> 00:44:17,154
...that you are safe.

392
00:44:17,322 --> 00:44:22,701
You, Junior, Holly.
You are completely safe.

393
00:44:24,037 --> 00:44:27,748
Everything that I do, everything...

394
00:44:27,915 --> 00:44:31,168
...I do it to protect this family.

395
00:44:32,628 --> 00:44:37,007
So buying that car,
that was protecting your family?

396
00:44:39,552 --> 00:44:42,346
Okay. I...

397
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:47,267
All right, maybe it's a little flashy,
but he needed a car...

398
00:44:48,394 --> 00:44:52,564
...and I'm his father, and I should
be able to get what he wants.

399
00:44:55,485 --> 00:44:57,861
It goes back.

400
00:44:58,363 --> 00:44:59,613
Tomorrow.

401
00:45:00,114 --> 00:45:03,283
Skyler, it will crush him.

402
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:08,372
That car directly contradicts
our story.

403
00:45:08,998 --> 00:45:12,084
And if you're so invested
in protecting this family...

404
00:45:12,251 --> 00:45:15,128
...it means protecting the story.

405
00:45:15,296 --> 00:45:18,215
What do you think the neighbors
are gonna say, Walt?

406
00:45:18,383 --> 00:45:19,925
What about Hank and Marie?

407
00:45:20,426 --> 00:45:24,012
How about the IRS?
What were you thinking, walt?

408
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:28,975
I was thinking that I wanted
to do something nice for my son.

409
00:45:37,777 --> 00:45:39,361
Look.

410
00:45:41,489 --> 00:45:44,866
I just worry that he'll blame you
for this.

411
00:45:48,621 --> 00:45:50,372
Oh, he will.

412
00:45:50,873 --> 00:45:53,417
Once again,
he'll blame his bitch mother...

413
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:57,546
...for taking away
what his loving father has given him...

414
00:45:58,131 --> 00:46:00,215
...so thanks for that.

415
00:46:02,677 --> 00:46:04,886
But you know what, Walt?

416
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:07,639
Someone has to protect this family...

417
00:46:07,807 --> 00:46:11,101
...from the man
who protects this family.
