1
00:00:20,775 --> 00:00:22,151
Hey.

2
00:00:24,946 --> 00:00:26,447
You...

3
00:00:27,031 --> 00:00:28,783
You selling?

4
00:00:29,826 --> 00:00:31,577
I don't know
what you're talking about.

5
00:00:31,786 --> 00:00:33,996
Okay. That's cool.

6
00:00:36,499 --> 00:00:40,503
I'm just saying, you know,
if you were selling...

7
00:00:40,837 --> 00:00:43,214
...I could maybe do with a teenth.

8
00:00:46,134 --> 00:00:47,802
You're kidding, right?

9
00:00:48,803 --> 00:00:51,139
Dude, I so smell bacon.

10
00:00:51,347 --> 00:00:53,641
What? What are you talking about?

11
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:55,518
Oh, gee, I don't know.

12
00:00:55,726 --> 00:00:58,563
How about over there.
That brown van.

13
00:00:59,772 --> 00:01:00,940
That's yours, right?

14
00:01:01,149 --> 00:01:03,067
What brown van?

15
00:01:03,317 --> 00:01:05,444
Parked all inconspicuous.

16
00:01:05,653 --> 00:01:07,738
It's a cop van.

17
00:01:08,322 --> 00:01:10,992
Yeah, another one right over there.

18
00:01:11,826 --> 00:01:14,453
"Duke City Flowers"? Come on.

19
00:01:14,662 --> 00:01:16,706
Can't you at least be original?

20
00:01:16,914 --> 00:01:19,333
Dude, I just wanna get high.

21
00:01:19,542 --> 00:01:21,752
A flower van.

22
00:01:22,378 --> 00:01:25,089
You know what you should do
is a garbage truck.

23
00:01:25,298 --> 00:01:27,258
Seriously, and I don't mean
to disrespect...

24
00:01:27,467 --> 00:01:30,052
...but if you put cops
in the back of a garbage truck...

25
00:01:30,261 --> 00:01:32,346
...there's no way
I'm seriously thinking...

26
00:01:32,555 --> 00:01:35,850
...that there's cops
in the back of a garbage truck.

27
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:38,686
It's a freebie, yo. Just think about it.

28
00:01:38,895 --> 00:01:41,063
Think about it, boys.

29
00:01:42,148 --> 00:01:45,109
All right. I'm hitting it.

30
00:01:46,152 --> 00:01:47,778
You dudes give up that easy?

31
00:01:47,987 --> 00:01:49,989
I'm not a cop.

32
00:01:50,573 --> 00:01:54,160
Then lift your shirt.
Show me you're not wearing a wire.

33
00:01:55,953 --> 00:01:57,413
All right, you know what?

34
00:01:57,622 --> 00:02:00,416
Just to show you
you're being an asshole.

35
00:02:00,625 --> 00:02:02,710
I'm blinded by white.

36
00:02:02,919 --> 00:02:03,920
Douchebag.

37
00:02:04,128 --> 00:02:06,631
Come on. I was joking. Come on.

38
00:02:06,839 --> 00:02:10,218
Don't walk away angry.
Sit down. Come on.

39
00:02:12,011 --> 00:02:13,721
I mean, what are you
complaining about?

40
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:16,182
You got abs, man. Kind of.

41
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:18,267
Whatever, dude.

42
00:02:18,476 --> 00:02:20,186
I'm not even sure
I wanna buy anymore.

43
00:02:20,394 --> 00:02:23,064
I think you turned me off
to the whole thing.

44
00:02:23,272 --> 00:02:25,316
Come on. Don't be like that.

45
00:02:25,525 --> 00:02:28,736
I just need you to prove it,
you know?

46
00:02:28,945 --> 00:02:30,446
Prove you're not a cop.

47
00:02:30,655 --> 00:02:33,366
How the hell
am I supposed to do that?

48
00:02:34,242 --> 00:02:35,910
I don't know.

49
00:02:37,119 --> 00:02:40,498
Hey, I got it. Go over there
and punch that dude right in the face.

50
00:02:40,706 --> 00:02:42,458
Which dude?

51
00:02:42,667 --> 00:02:43,918
That dude?
-Yeah.

52
00:02:44,126 --> 00:02:46,587
No way. He'd kick my ass.

53
00:02:47,547 --> 00:02:49,090
True that.

54
00:02:50,383 --> 00:02:53,719
This is so hard, you know?
-Yeah.

55
00:02:56,514 --> 00:02:58,057
I know.

56
00:02:58,307 --> 00:03:00,101
It's simple.

57
00:03:00,434 --> 00:03:04,772
If you ask a cop if he's a cop,
he's, like, obligated to tell you.

58
00:03:04,981 --> 00:03:06,858
It's in the Constitution.

59
00:03:07,066 --> 00:03:09,193
Constitution of America?

60
00:03:11,445 --> 00:03:14,157
So go ahead and ask.

61
00:03:14,365 --> 00:03:16,659
You a cop?
-No, no. Not like that.

62
00:03:16,868 --> 00:03:18,995
Ask it, like, official.

63
00:03:19,203 --> 00:03:21,789
Are you a police officer?

64
00:03:22,331 --> 00:03:25,877
No, I am not a police officer.

65
00:03:26,085 --> 00:03:29,130
Okay, then. Hundred
and seventy-five for a teenth.

66
00:03:30,173 --> 00:03:32,133
The price is the price, yo.

67
00:03:36,596 --> 00:03:38,264
All right.

68
00:04:03,831 --> 00:04:06,626
There you go. Enjoy.

69
00:04:07,543 --> 00:04:09,253
Thanks, man.

70
00:04:15,384 --> 00:04:18,346
Albuquerque Police!
You're under arrest! Get on the ground!

71
00:04:18,554 --> 00:04:23,017
Get on your stomach now!
On your stomach! Get on the ground!

72
00:04:24,101 --> 00:04:27,146
Hold it right there. Don't move.
Stay down.

73
00:04:48,376 --> 00:04:53,256
<i>I had a good job
until my boss accused me of stealing.</i>

74
00:04:54,465 --> 00:04:56,425
<i>I'd better call Saul!</i>

75
00:04:59,595 --> 00:05:02,974
<i>I was out partying,
minding my own business...</i>

76
00:05:04,392 --> 00:05:07,895
<i>-You are under arrest.
-I'd better call Saul!</i>

77
00:05:08,813 --> 00:05:09,897
<i>Hi, I'm Saul Goodman.</i>

78
00:05:10,106 --> 00:05:11,816
<i>Did you know that you have rights?</i>

79
00:05:12,024 --> 00:05:14,485
<i>The Constitution says you do.
And so do I.</i>

80
00:05:14,694 --> 00:05:16,654
<i>I believe that until proven guilty...</i>

81
00:05:16,863 --> 00:05:20,032
<i>...every man, woman,
and child in this country is innocent.</i>

82
00:05:20,241 --> 00:05:22,201
<i>And that's why I fight for you,
Albuquerque.</i>

83
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:23,411
<i>Better call Saul.</i>

84
00:05:23,619 --> 00:05:25,705
<i>Saul Goodman, attorney at law,
505-164-CALL.</i>

85
00:05:25,913 --> 00:05:28,916
<i>That's 505-164-CALL.</i>

86
00:05:30,626 --> 00:05:34,297
I really need to get some furniture.

87
00:05:35,631 --> 00:05:37,091
I suggest you start with a bed.

88
00:05:40,511 --> 00:05:43,055
God, I wish we could smoke in here.

89
00:05:43,264 --> 00:05:46,601
Well, you can't.
-Yeah, no. I know.

90
00:05:46,809 --> 00:05:48,811
I'm just saying.

91
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:53,065
Don't think I can't smell that weed.

92
00:05:53,274 --> 00:05:55,151
You better seriously hope
that airs out.

93
00:05:55,359 --> 00:05:58,112
My dad will keep
your security deposit.

94
00:05:59,322 --> 00:06:02,617
He has a nose
like a damn bloodhound.

95
00:06:02,825 --> 00:06:04,452
Yeah?

96
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:08,873
Has he ever caught you?

97
00:06:09,832 --> 00:06:13,711
Yeah. Many times.

98
00:06:14,921 --> 00:06:16,589
Well, listen.

99
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:20,635
Since I already lost my deposit
and all...

100
00:06:20,843 --> 00:06:23,429
...maybe we should light up.

101
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:29,018
No, thanks.

102
00:06:29,227 --> 00:06:30,228
You sure?

103
00:06:31,771 --> 00:06:34,190
Well, is it cool if I burn one?

104
00:06:34,398 --> 00:06:36,651
Maybe you'll change your mind.

105
00:06:40,988 --> 00:06:42,949
Do what you wanna do, I guess.

106
00:06:48,996 --> 00:06:51,290
Hey. What'd I say?

107
00:06:51,833 --> 00:06:53,334
Nothing.

108
00:06:54,544 --> 00:06:56,504
I just have to go is all.

109
00:07:15,982 --> 00:07:16,983
What's this?

110
00:07:18,568 --> 00:07:20,153
My 18-month chip.

111
00:07:22,864 --> 00:07:23,865
I'm in recovery.

112
00:07:24,073 --> 00:07:29,704
And, you know,
pot is like stepping stones.

113
00:07:32,081 --> 00:07:36,252
Recovery? That's cool.

114
00:07:36,461 --> 00:07:37,795
Right on.

115
00:07:38,588 --> 00:07:40,173
I respect that.

116
00:07:40,381 --> 00:07:43,217
You know,
I don't really burn much anymore.

117
00:07:43,426 --> 00:07:46,345
It's just a sometime thing.

118
00:07:47,513 --> 00:07:50,558
But no more, like, in the house.

119
00:07:54,103 --> 00:07:57,356
So you wanna go grab
some dinner?

120
00:07:57,565 --> 00:08:00,067
I could really go for some Chinese.

121
00:08:00,276 --> 00:08:01,736
No, I better hit it.

122
00:08:03,488 --> 00:08:05,156
We...

123
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:07,074
We cool?

124
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,205
Your satellite is on, by the way.

125
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:17,877
That screen is badass.

126
00:08:32,183 --> 00:08:34,268
I just think it's asking a lot.

127
00:08:34,477 --> 00:08:36,479
He knows it.

128
00:08:36,687 --> 00:08:38,356
He's done nothing but apologise.

129
00:08:39,941 --> 00:08:41,484
Is this gonna be
every weekend now?

130
00:08:41,692 --> 00:08:44,987
No. It's just the end of the quarter.
You remember how that was.

131
00:08:45,196 --> 00:08:49,784
But I am earning double time,
so there's a bright side.

132
00:08:49,992 --> 00:08:52,370
So when the laziest boy
in the world wakes up...

133
00:08:52,578 --> 00:08:54,539
...tell him he better wash
those sneakers.

134
00:08:54,747 --> 00:08:55,748
And I said bye.

135
00:08:55,957 --> 00:08:58,292
And tell him
to let them air-dry this time.

136
00:08:58,501 --> 00:09:01,254
I don't want him
banging the hell out of my dryer.

137
00:09:02,088 --> 00:09:03,089
What?

138
00:09:04,715 --> 00:09:06,926
What, you don't even get
casual Saturday?

139
00:09:07,135 --> 00:09:08,219
I mean...

140
00:09:08,427 --> 00:09:10,096
No, it's just you...

141
00:09:10,304 --> 00:09:12,223
You look nice is all.

142
00:09:12,431 --> 00:09:14,642
It's work, Walt.
And everybody is gonna be there.

143
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:16,811
Okay.
-Okay.

144
00:09:17,019 --> 00:09:19,480
Maybe we'll order a pizza tonight?

145
00:09:19,689 --> 00:09:21,107
Okay.

146
00:09:21,816 --> 00:09:22,817
Bye.
-Bye.

147
00:09:35,246 --> 00:09:38,291
<i>Hi. You've reached Walt,
Skyler and Walter, Jr.</i>

148
00:09:38,499 --> 00:09:40,835
<i>Please leave a message,
and we'll get back to you.</i>

149
00:09:41,043 --> 00:09:45,548
<i>Skyler? Are you there?
I don't know what to do.</i>

150
00:09:45,756 --> 00:09:49,343
<i>I... I need to talk to you. I...</i>

151
00:09:49,552 --> 00:09:53,097
Hey, Marie. It's me. What's up?

152
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:02,440
Yesterday I got home
and found him.

153
00:10:03,107 --> 00:10:05,610
He didn't even tell me
he was coming.

154
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:09,530
A man was killed?
-A Federale, right in front of him.

155
00:10:10,448 --> 00:10:13,826
Three agents wounded,
one lost his leg.

156
00:10:14,035 --> 00:10:17,663
It's like what you hear about
from Iraq or something.

157
00:10:17,872 --> 00:10:20,666
The IEDs.
-Oh, Jesus.

158
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:23,711
I had to hear about it
from Steve Gomez.

159
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,339
Hank talked to his ASAC
for about an hour.

160
00:10:26,547 --> 00:10:29,801
Hank could win an Oscar.
He's so damn breezy with the man.

161
00:10:30,009 --> 00:10:33,054
He hangs up the phone,
goes right back to bed.

162
00:10:33,262 --> 00:10:39,101
And all he keeps saying is,
"I'm fine. I'm fine. Leave me alone."

163
00:11:03,251 --> 00:11:04,919
Baby, not now.

164
00:11:06,212 --> 00:11:09,132
It's-It's me, Hank. Sorry.

165
00:11:12,969 --> 00:11:14,929
Hey, buddy. What's...?

166
00:11:15,138 --> 00:11:16,681
What's up?

167
00:11:19,058 --> 00:11:20,601
I just...

168
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:23,187
Do you mind if I...?

169
00:11:23,479 --> 00:11:25,398
No. No.

170
00:11:27,567 --> 00:11:29,277
So...

171
00:11:32,613 --> 00:11:33,739
How you doing?

172
00:11:34,323 --> 00:11:36,993
Oh, you know, lousy.

173
00:11:37,577 --> 00:11:39,078
Montezuma's revenge, bigtime.

174
00:11:39,287 --> 00:11:44,625
I mean, everything's going through me
like crap through a tinhorn.

175
00:11:44,876 --> 00:11:46,586
Better not get too close.

176
00:11:46,794 --> 00:11:49,755
Well, I'll take my chances.

177
00:11:58,097 --> 00:12:01,767
I guess you heard about
what happened down in Juárez?

178
00:12:03,478 --> 00:12:05,146
Terrible.

179
00:12:06,063 --> 00:12:08,483
What do you expect?
Bunch of freaking animals.

180
00:12:08,691 --> 00:12:10,318
<i>It's like Apocalypse Now
down there.</i>

181
00:12:10,526 --> 00:12:14,363
It's like Colonel Kurtz
holed up in his jungle.

182
00:12:16,073 --> 00:12:19,494
And my SAC in EI Paso
sends me home.

183
00:12:20,369 --> 00:12:24,081
Now, that's a sound leadership
decision right there, huh?

184
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:27,376
You know, you don't put
your second most senior man...

185
00:12:27,585 --> 00:12:29,670
...on the trail
of those motherless bastards...

186
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:32,381
...you send him home. You know?

187
00:12:32,882 --> 00:12:35,510
I was, you know-
"He's out getting an evidence bag...

188
00:12:35,718 --> 00:12:37,637
...and so ends up
without a scratch on him.

189
00:12:37,845 --> 00:12:41,349
So must be something wrong
with that picture, you know."

190
00:12:43,893 --> 00:12:46,854
So are you home for good then?

191
00:12:48,272 --> 00:12:50,358
No, no. It's...

192
00:12:50,566 --> 00:12:54,445
Playing it by ear. To be determined.

193
00:12:56,989 --> 00:13:00,785
Think you might wanna talk it through
with somebody?

194
00:13:00,993 --> 00:13:04,038
What, a shrink?
No, no, no. Can't go down that road.

195
00:13:04,247 --> 00:13:06,958
Start going down that road,
kiss your career goodbye.

196
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:13,840
Or Marie. Or me, if you like.

197
00:13:20,096 --> 00:13:24,225
You know, I don't know
how to say this. I...

198
00:13:26,227 --> 00:13:28,312
You know, the things I deal with...

199
00:13:29,522 --> 00:13:32,775
...you and me don't have much of a-

200
00:13:32,984 --> 00:13:37,029
What you might call
"an experiential overlap."

201
00:13:45,288 --> 00:13:47,707
What if I told you we do?

202
00:13:55,214 --> 00:13:59,677
I have spent my whole life scared.

203
00:14:01,721 --> 00:14:04,849
Frightened of things
that could happen...

204
00:14:05,057 --> 00:14:07,393
...might happen, might not happen.

205
00:14:07,602 --> 00:14:11,105
Fifty years I spent like that.

206
00:14:12,899 --> 00:14:16,444
Finding myself awake
at 3 in the morning.

207
00:14:20,072 --> 00:14:21,866
But you know what?

208
00:14:22,867 --> 00:14:25,453
Ever since my diagnosis...

209
00:14:26,996 --> 00:14:29,081
...I sleep just fine.

210
00:14:34,837 --> 00:14:36,339
Okay.

211
00:14:37,048 --> 00:14:42,345
And I came to realise
it's that fear that's the worst of it.

212
00:14:42,553 --> 00:14:44,722
That's the real enemy.

213
00:14:47,517 --> 00:14:49,060
So...

214
00:14:51,312 --> 00:14:52,730
Get up.

215
00:14:53,189 --> 00:14:55,483
Get out in the real world.

216
00:14:56,108 --> 00:15:00,863
And you kick that bastard
as hard as you can right in the teeth.

217
00:15:15,837 --> 00:15:18,589
Do it again. Go on.

218
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:28,850
Ten thousand even, same as last time.
It's totally accurate.

219
00:15:29,433 --> 00:15:31,477
You and I,
we are gonna feed this machine.

220
00:15:31,686 --> 00:15:35,314
I want it running 24 hours a day.
-Right on.

221
00:15:42,738 --> 00:15:44,323
Not yours, I take it.

222
00:15:46,284 --> 00:15:51,456
We got 10, 20, 30...

223
00:15:51,664 --> 00:15:56,669
...44, five each.

224
00:15:58,629 --> 00:16:02,008
Three pounds should be 48 each.

225
00:16:02,216 --> 00:16:03,259
Who's short?

226
00:16:03,468 --> 00:16:06,220
All right. Don't freak, all right?
We didn't get ripped off.

227
00:16:06,429 --> 00:16:08,389
But Badger hasn't kicked in
his full amount.

228
00:16:08,598 --> 00:16:10,892
I know he was planning on pulling
an all-nighter...

229
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,810
...so he's probably still in the sack.

230
00:16:13,019 --> 00:16:16,898
Then wake him up.
He can sleep after we're paid.

231
00:16:17,106 --> 00:16:19,567
Why you gotta be such a hard-on?

232
00:16:19,775 --> 00:16:22,278
You're not his pal. You're his boss.

233
00:16:22,487 --> 00:16:24,906
This only works when
they're scared of you, remember?

234
00:16:26,032 --> 00:16:28,201
Jack-off.

235
00:16:31,621 --> 00:16:33,581
It's going straight to voicemail.

236
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:36,083
Voicemail?

237
00:16:37,001 --> 00:16:40,338
Just chill, okay? Count your money.

238
00:16:45,593 --> 00:16:46,844
<i>-Combo.
-Yo, what's up?</i>

239
00:16:47,053 --> 00:16:49,263
You seen Badger?

240
00:16:50,306 --> 00:16:52,183
Don't you cover for him, bitch.

241
00:16:52,391 --> 00:16:55,269
I ask you a straight-up question,
I expect a straight-up answer.

242
00:17:11,202 --> 00:17:12,537
Well?

243
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:18,876
They were too scared to tell me.

244
00:17:20,503 --> 00:17:22,130
Badger got busted.

245
00:17:22,338 --> 00:17:24,132
He's in jail.

246
00:18:01,586 --> 00:18:03,921
<i>Honey, I'm home!</i>

247
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:06,340
Too slow! What's up?

248
00:18:06,549 --> 00:18:08,342
Got more lives than a damn cat.

249
00:18:08,551 --> 00:18:10,511
Now if I could only learn
to lick myself.

250
00:18:11,554 --> 00:18:14,849
What's up, guys? Good to see you.
Good to see you. Good to see you.

251
00:18:15,057 --> 00:18:18,853
All right. Let's all get back to work,
for chrissake, okay?

252
00:18:19,061 --> 00:18:22,315
In my office, man. Let's see
what you bozos been up to lately.

253
00:18:45,797 --> 00:18:46,881
You okay?

254
00:18:47,089 --> 00:18:48,591
Hanging in?

255
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,510
What's it look like?

256
00:18:51,302 --> 00:18:54,055
What's this from A.P.D.?
-Been checking with them to see...

257
00:18:54,263 --> 00:18:56,724
...if they come across
that famous blue meth of yours.

258
00:18:56,933 --> 00:18:59,393
Sure enough, last night.

259
00:18:59,602 --> 00:19:02,021
Got themselves
an honest-to-God dealer.

260
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:05,525
I was thinking of cruising over
and saying hello.

261
00:19:06,275 --> 00:19:07,735
Maybe you'd like to go with me?

262
00:19:08,861 --> 00:19:11,239
Yeah. Well, all right.

263
00:19:12,031 --> 00:19:14,242
You told me to my face
you weren't a cop, man.

264
00:19:15,117 --> 00:19:16,869
I feel manipulated.

265
00:19:17,078 --> 00:19:18,663
I thought we were gonna hang out.

266
00:19:18,871 --> 00:19:20,373
We are hanging out, Badger.

267
00:19:20,581 --> 00:19:22,917
You like Badger or Brandon?

268
00:19:23,751 --> 00:19:28,214
I like people who don't, like,
abuse the Constitution.

269
00:19:28,422 --> 00:19:29,590
Badger, listen.

270
00:19:30,216 --> 00:19:31,551
Hey.

271
00:19:31,968 --> 00:19:34,303
I'm trying to help you here, man.

272
00:19:34,846 --> 00:19:39,183
Now, if you just tell me
who your supplier is...

273
00:19:39,392 --> 00:19:42,311
...I think this can end
very well for you.

274
00:19:43,312 --> 00:19:46,524
What are you doing, detective, talking
to my client without me present?

275
00:19:46,732 --> 00:19:47,775
You sneaky Pete.

276
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:50,444
Which is which?

277
00:19:50,653 --> 00:19:53,072
What, did the academy hire you
right out of the womb?

278
00:19:53,281 --> 00:19:55,074
You guys get younger every-

279
00:19:55,283 --> 00:19:56,951
What'd you say to baby face?

280
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,578
Did you say anything stupid?

281
00:19:58,786 --> 00:20:00,788
By "anything stupid,"
I mean anything at all.

282
00:20:00,997 --> 00:20:03,458
Look at you.
Mouth open, vocal chords a-twitter.

283
00:20:03,666 --> 00:20:06,002
We'll talk about it later.
Right now, you out.

284
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:09,464
Ten minutes ago. Go on.
There are laws, detective.

285
00:20:09,672 --> 00:20:11,841
Have your kindergarten teacher
read them to you.

286
00:20:12,049 --> 00:20:15,761
Go grab a juice box.
Have a nap. Go on.

287
00:20:19,307 --> 00:20:20,308
All right.

288
00:20:21,476 --> 00:20:23,227
Who do we have?

289
00:20:23,936 --> 00:20:25,146
Brandon Mayhew.

290
00:20:25,354 --> 00:20:28,649
Brandon Mayhew. All right.

291
00:20:29,108 --> 00:20:31,235
Brandon Mayhew.

292
00:20:34,197 --> 00:20:37,074
Here we go. Public masturbation.
-What?

293
00:20:37,283 --> 00:20:40,161
I don't get it. What's the kick?
Why don't you do it at home...

294
00:20:40,369 --> 00:20:43,998
...with a big flat-screen TV,
50 channels of pay-per-view?

295
00:20:44,207 --> 00:20:46,709
In a Starbucks. That's nice.

296
00:20:46,918 --> 00:20:48,836
That ain't me, man. I...

297
00:20:49,045 --> 00:20:53,800
I was the guy who was selling meth.
Allegedly.

298
00:20:54,842 --> 00:20:56,844
Okay. All right. I got you.
Meth. Right.

299
00:20:57,053 --> 00:20:59,180
Sorry, that was a little
transpositional error.

300
00:20:59,388 --> 00:21:02,016
Nothing a little Wite-Out
can't take care of.

301
00:21:02,225 --> 00:21:05,144
Yeah, and felony quantity.

302
00:21:05,353 --> 00:21:07,647
Just barely.
-Yeah, just barely.

303
00:21:07,855 --> 00:21:10,900
The cops are like butchers.
Always got their thumbs on the scales.

304
00:21:11,108 --> 00:21:12,985
But good luck arguing that in court.

305
00:21:14,445 --> 00:21:15,905
Let me get down to brass tacks.

306
00:21:16,113 --> 00:21:17,824
I'm gonna get you
a second phone call.

307
00:21:18,032 --> 00:21:20,034
You're gonna call
your mommy or your daddy...

308
00:21:20,243 --> 00:21:22,620
...or your parish priest
or your Boy Scout leader...

309
00:21:22,829 --> 00:21:25,957
...and they're gonna
deliver me a cheque for $4650.

310
00:21:26,165 --> 00:21:28,793
I'm gonna write that down
on the back of my business card.

311
00:21:29,001 --> 00:21:31,546
Four-six-five-zero. Okay?

312
00:21:31,754 --> 00:21:35,883
And I need that in a cashier's cheque
or a money order, doesn't matter.

313
00:21:36,092 --> 00:21:38,553
Actually, I want it in a money order.

314
00:21:38,761 --> 00:21:41,514
And make it out to
"Ice Station Zebra Associates."

315
00:21:41,722 --> 00:21:44,183
That's my loan-out. It's totally legit.

316
00:21:44,392 --> 00:21:46,435
It's done just for tax purposes.

317
00:21:46,644 --> 00:21:49,188
And after that,
we can discuss Visa or MasterCard...

318
00:21:49,397 --> 00:21:53,276
...but definitely not American Express,
so don't even ask. All right?

319
00:21:53,484 --> 00:21:54,527
Any questions?

320
00:21:57,572 --> 00:21:59,448
You're gonna get me off, right?

321
00:22:00,533 --> 00:22:04,328
What do I look like, your high-school
girlfriend? Five fingers, no waiting?

322
00:22:04,954 --> 00:22:08,207
That's a joke, Brandon. Lighten up.

323
00:22:08,749 --> 00:22:12,211
Son, I promise you this.

324
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:15,548
I will give you
the best criminal defence...

325
00:22:15,756 --> 00:22:17,133
...that money can buy.

326
00:22:19,093 --> 00:22:21,220
Yeah, but, Francesca,
I took these already.

327
00:22:21,429 --> 00:22:23,139
Didn't I take these already?

328
00:22:23,347 --> 00:22:26,309
It's on your head. You're not
supposed to double up on vitamin A.

329
00:22:26,517 --> 00:22:28,394
It's bad for the liver.

330
00:22:29,979 --> 00:22:32,106
Okay, who's next?

331
00:22:32,315 --> 00:22:34,567
Did him. I did him.

332
00:22:34,775 --> 00:22:37,028
That one went public defender.
Thanks for nothing.

333
00:22:37,236 --> 00:22:40,323
What happened to my masturbator?
You got me all turned around.

334
00:22:40,865 --> 00:22:42,408
Hang on. I'll get back to you.

335
00:22:43,701 --> 00:22:47,371
I sense you're discussing my client.
Anything you care to share with me?

336
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:50,208
Sure. Your commercials?
They suck ass.

337
00:22:50,917 --> 00:22:53,544
I've seen better acting
in an epileptic whorehouse.

338
00:22:53,753 --> 00:22:55,505
Is that like the one
your mom works at?

339
00:22:55,713 --> 00:22:58,508
Is she still offering
the two-for-one discount?

340
00:22:58,716 --> 00:23:01,594
DEA, huh? For a street bust.

341
00:23:01,803 --> 00:23:04,931
Now, what would two feds
want with that little twerp?

342
00:23:19,028 --> 00:23:20,988
Sooner or later,
this was gonna happen.

343
00:23:21,197 --> 00:23:23,533
You want your exponential growth...

344
00:23:23,741 --> 00:23:25,785
...guys are gonna get busted.
Simple as that.

345
00:23:25,993 --> 00:23:28,913
How about we get him a real attorney?
What the hell is this?

346
00:23:29,122 --> 00:23:30,790
This is who he hires?

347
00:23:30,998 --> 00:23:34,001
What? Are you kidding me?
This is the guy you want.

348
00:23:35,419 --> 00:23:37,046
This is the guy I'd hire.

349
00:23:37,839 --> 00:23:39,215
It's the guy you'd hire.

350
00:23:39,423 --> 00:23:40,758
Look, you remember Emilio?

351
00:23:41,217 --> 00:23:44,095
Okay, this dude got Emilio off,
like, twice. Okay?

352
00:23:44,303 --> 00:23:48,850
Both times, they had him
dead to rights, yo. And then, poof.

353
00:23:49,058 --> 00:23:50,226
Dude is like Houdini.

354
00:23:50,434 --> 00:23:52,228
Seriously,
when the going gets tough...

355
00:23:52,436 --> 00:23:54,272
...you don't want a criminal lawyer.

356
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,817
You want a "criminal" lawyer.

357
00:23:58,025 --> 00:23:59,819
Know what I'm saying?

358
00:24:01,404 --> 00:24:03,531
Look, we're in good shape,
Mr. White.

359
00:24:03,739 --> 00:24:05,992
Badger is way too loyal to roll.

360
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,161
Plus, he's scared shitless of me,
all right.

361
00:24:08,369 --> 00:24:12,665
We pay four large. Cost of business.
Take it out of his payroll.

362
00:24:12,874 --> 00:24:14,625
And it's only his first dealing rap...

363
00:24:14,834 --> 00:24:17,420
...so, worst-case scenario,
you know, they plead him out.

364
00:24:17,628 --> 00:24:21,174
He does five months picking up litter
in an orange jump suit.

365
00:24:22,383 --> 00:24:26,345
So who goes inside?
I don't need them seeing my face.

366
00:24:26,554 --> 00:24:29,098
Well, I don't need them
seeing my face.

367
00:24:29,307 --> 00:24:32,393
Why not?
You look like his typical clientele.

368
00:24:32,602 --> 00:24:34,061
Dick.

369
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:35,771
Fine.

370
00:24:36,355 --> 00:24:38,983
We'll flip for it, all right? Call it.

371
00:24:40,568 --> 00:24:42,195
Heads.

372
00:24:55,041 --> 00:24:58,377
Mayhew? Mr. Mayhew?

373
00:25:11,849 --> 00:25:14,227
Mr. Mayhew.

374
00:25:14,435 --> 00:25:17,396
Nice of you to come down. Please.

375
00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:18,856
Look at you.

376
00:25:19,273 --> 00:25:23,069
Should I call the FBI
and tell them I found D.B. Cooper?

377
00:25:23,444 --> 00:25:24,445
Joking.

378
00:25:24,654 --> 00:25:26,739
I-Please, come on.

379
00:25:26,948 --> 00:25:28,741
Come on. Please.

380
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:30,743
Hello.

381
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:34,122
Saul Goodman. Please sit.

382
00:25:36,749 --> 00:25:41,587
So it's a shame that we have to meet
under these circumstances.

383
00:25:45,967 --> 00:25:48,928
I believe you have
something for me?

384
00:25:49,262 --> 00:25:51,264
Oh, yes.

385
00:25:53,891 --> 00:25:58,229
Mayhew. Is that Irish or English?
-Irish.

386
00:25:58,437 --> 00:26:01,274
Faith and begorra.
A fellow potato-eater.

387
00:26:02,483 --> 00:26:03,860
My real name is McGill.

388
00:26:04,485 --> 00:26:06,279
The Jew thing
I just do for the homeboys.

389
00:26:06,487 --> 00:26:10,533
They all want a pipe-hitting member
of the tribe, so to speak.

390
00:26:11,117 --> 00:26:13,995
I digress.
Good things are happening.

391
00:26:14,203 --> 00:26:18,040
Fact is, your nephew is gonna
get out in no time.

392
00:26:18,249 --> 00:26:19,876
That's wonderful, yeah.

393
00:26:20,084 --> 00:26:22,462
There's still a few details
to be ironed out...

394
00:26:22,670 --> 00:26:24,630
...but now that the DEA
is involved...

395
00:26:25,089 --> 00:26:28,551
...I think he's looking
at time served, then probation.

396
00:26:28,759 --> 00:26:32,138
So leave your number with Francesca,
and we'll be in touch.

397
00:26:32,346 --> 00:26:33,973
Excuse me, the DEA?
-Yeah.

398
00:26:34,182 --> 00:26:37,768
That's the Drug Enforcement
Administration. The feds.

399
00:26:40,521 --> 00:26:42,982
I hope that I'm not
the breaker of bad news...

400
00:26:43,191 --> 00:26:46,736
...but your nephew got mixed up
with some pretty nasty customers.

401
00:26:46,944 --> 00:26:47,945
I understand that.

402
00:26:48,154 --> 00:26:49,864
What does that have
to do with the DEA?

403
00:26:50,072 --> 00:26:51,574
They're after some mystery man...

404
00:26:51,782 --> 00:26:54,243
...some heavy-hitter
that goes by the name Heisenberg.

405
00:26:54,452 --> 00:26:56,871
They want this guy
like the axe wants the turkey.

406
00:26:57,079 --> 00:26:58,998
Seems young Brandon
may have information...

407
00:26:59,207 --> 00:27:01,042
...that could lead to his arrest.

408
00:27:01,584 --> 00:27:03,586
Jesus, cheer up.
This is good news.

409
00:27:03,795 --> 00:27:06,339
I mean, Brandon fell head-first
into the doo-doo pile...

410
00:27:06,547 --> 00:27:08,508
...and came up
smelling like Paco Rabanne.

411
00:27:09,634 --> 00:27:12,845
Wait, wait. Look, I just... I think...

412
00:27:13,054 --> 00:27:18,184
I just think that we should
review our options.

413
00:27:18,392 --> 00:27:19,811
Options?

414
00:27:20,019 --> 00:27:22,021
I'm gonna tell you
what your options are.

415
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:25,817
You got a grand total of two.
Option A: Brandon takes the deal.

416
00:27:26,025 --> 00:27:28,194
Option B:
Brandon goes up to the penitentiary...

417
00:27:28,402 --> 00:27:31,030
...and gets his rectum
resized about yay big.

418
00:27:31,239 --> 00:27:34,867
Look, look. What about reprisals?

419
00:27:35,076 --> 00:27:36,869
I mean, if Badger-

420
00:27:37,078 --> 00:27:42,542
If Brandon informs
on this Heisenberg...

421
00:27:43,042 --> 00:27:44,710
I mean, what if, God forbid...

422
00:27:44,919 --> 00:27:49,715
...that they decide to take revenge?

423
00:27:49,924 --> 00:27:51,717
What have you been telling him?

424
00:27:51,926 --> 00:27:55,346
The kid keeps spouting off about,
"If I talk, they'll kill me."

425
00:27:55,555 --> 00:27:58,474
Right now, he's the only thing
holding up this deal.

426
00:27:59,433 --> 00:28:02,353
Good.
-No, that's not good. That's terrible.

427
00:28:02,562 --> 00:28:05,648
Trust me, sir, your nephew
won't last in prison two weeks.

428
00:28:05,857 --> 00:28:08,526
You let him take his chances
on the outside.

429
00:28:08,734 --> 00:28:10,695
Maybe I can work
in some witness protection.

430
00:28:10,903 --> 00:28:14,574
No, look, look.
These are vicious, desperate people.

431
00:28:14,782 --> 00:28:19,745
I've been told that
one of them killed another man...

432
00:28:19,954 --> 00:28:23,416
...by crushing his head
with an ATM machine.

433
00:28:24,625 --> 00:28:27,086
People love to take credit
for the fun ones.

434
00:28:27,295 --> 00:28:30,756
The guy who got his head smooshed
used to be a client of mine.

435
00:28:30,965 --> 00:28:33,551
His wife killed him, all right?
It was open and shut.

436
00:28:33,759 --> 00:28:36,262
Trust me, you folks have
nothing to worry about, okay?

437
00:28:36,471 --> 00:28:39,807
I'm gonna set your nephew straight,
get him singing like a canary...

438
00:28:40,016 --> 00:28:42,435
...all's right with the world.

439
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:46,647
Ten thousand dollars.

440
00:29:00,328 --> 00:29:03,122
Ten thousand, cash to you.

441
00:29:04,332 --> 00:29:08,002
I'm not saying to throw the case.

442
00:29:08,211 --> 00:29:13,299
Just no talking to the DEA.

443
00:29:14,342 --> 00:29:16,636
Are you saying
what I think you're saying?

444
00:29:17,428 --> 00:29:18,805
Yes.

445
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,474
What's it going to be?

446
00:29:23,976 --> 00:29:26,312
What, dude wouldn't take a bribe?

447
00:29:26,729 --> 00:29:29,482
That dude in there?
Saul Goodman we're talking about?

448
00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:31,359
Yeah. "Morally outraged," he said.

449
00:29:31,567 --> 00:29:32,985
Threatened to call the police.

450
00:29:33,194 --> 00:29:38,157
<i>-Wait, and Badger is gonna spill?
-Like the Exxon Valdez.</i>

451
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,285
So, what do we do about it?

452
00:29:51,963 --> 00:29:54,006
Hey, Francesca,
how about I follow you home?

453
00:29:54,215 --> 00:29:55,258
No.

454
00:29:55,466 --> 00:29:57,135
For safety.

455
00:29:57,343 --> 00:29:58,886
What?

456
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:03,641
God, you are killing me
with that booty.

457
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,865
Talk to me.
Come on, talk to me, guys, huh?

458
00:30:19,073 --> 00:30:22,702
Come on, just tell me what you want.
Jesus!

459
00:30:23,953 --> 00:30:26,038
Oh, no, no, no!

460
00:30:26,247 --> 00:30:29,167
No, it wasn't me.
It was Ignacio. He's the one.

461
00:30:29,375 --> 00:30:32,128
Oh, no. Oh, no, no, no.

462
00:30:35,006 --> 00:30:36,883
Shut up, dude.

463
00:30:37,341 --> 00:30:40,470
Shut up, all right?
Just speak English.

464
00:30:40,678 --> 00:30:43,556
Lalo didn't send you? No Lalo?

465
00:30:44,098 --> 00:30:47,310
Who?
-Oh, thank God! Oh, Christ!

466
00:30:47,518 --> 00:30:50,062
Oh, I thought...

467
00:30:51,063 --> 00:30:53,232
What can I do for you gentlemen?

468
00:30:53,441 --> 00:30:55,860
Anything.
Just tell me what you need.

469
00:30:56,068 --> 00:31:00,156
This afternoon, an associate of ours
offered you $10,000.

470
00:31:00,364 --> 00:31:01,908
You should have taken it.

471
00:31:02,116 --> 00:31:05,203
Wait a minute.
This is in regards to what's-his-name?

472
00:31:05,411 --> 00:31:07,830
Badger! Brandon Mayhew.

473
00:31:08,206 --> 00:31:10,541
The uncle. That was your guy?

474
00:31:11,751 --> 00:31:14,504
No offence, but I don't take bribes
from strangers, you know?

475
00:31:14,712 --> 00:31:17,048
Better safe than sorry.
That's my motto.

476
00:31:17,256 --> 00:31:21,677
But I'll take your money! Sure!
-No, that offer has expired, yo.

477
00:31:21,886 --> 00:31:25,807
It was kind of low anyways.
But okay, okay, I'll take it.

478
00:31:26,015 --> 00:31:27,725
Just tell me what you need,
all right?

479
00:31:27,934 --> 00:31:30,019
I'm easy. I'm gonna keep
a happy thought...

480
00:31:30,228 --> 00:31:32,522
...and assume
this is just a negotiating tactic.

481
00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:35,775
All right, listen to me very carefully.

482
00:31:35,983 --> 00:31:37,860
You are going to give
Badger Mayhew...

483
00:31:38,069 --> 00:31:41,197
...the best legal representation ever.

484
00:31:41,405 --> 00:31:43,658
But no deals with the DEA.

485
00:31:43,866 --> 00:31:47,537
All right? Badger will not identify
anyone to anybody.

486
00:31:47,745 --> 00:31:50,289
If he does, you're dead.

487
00:31:52,333 --> 00:31:54,710
Why don't you just kill Badger?

488
00:31:57,713 --> 00:32:00,508
I mean, follow me, but if a mosquito
is buzzing around you...

489
00:32:00,716 --> 00:32:03,928
...and it bites you on the ass,
you don't go gunning for the attorney.

490
00:32:04,137 --> 00:32:07,557
You go grab a fly swatter.
I mean, so to speak.

491
00:32:07,974 --> 00:32:11,144
I mean, all due respect,
but do I have to spell this out for you?

492
00:32:11,727 --> 00:32:14,772
We're not killing Badger, yo!
-Then you got real problems, okay.

493
00:32:14,981 --> 00:32:16,983
Because the DEA
will come down on your boy...

494
00:32:17,191 --> 00:32:19,110
...like a proverbial ton of bricks.

495
00:32:19,318 --> 00:32:21,404
I don't think
I'm going out on a limb here...

496
00:32:21,612 --> 00:32:23,406
...but, hey,
he's not gonna like prison.

497
00:32:23,614 --> 00:32:28,119
He's gonna sing like Celine Dion
regardless of what you do to me.

498
00:32:33,708 --> 00:32:35,001
Mr. Mayhew?

499
00:32:37,712 --> 00:32:41,340
I recognise your cough. Take that
mask off, you know. Get some air.

500
00:32:41,716 --> 00:32:43,217
Go on.

501
00:32:50,391 --> 00:32:52,018
God.
-Take it easy.

502
00:32:52,226 --> 00:32:54,854
Breathe in, breathe out.

503
00:32:55,062 --> 00:32:58,941
All right. I'm gonna stand up, all right?
Because I got bad knees.

504
00:32:59,692 --> 00:33:01,527
That's better.

505
00:33:02,278 --> 00:33:05,865
Okay, now listen. The three of us
are gonna work this out.

506
00:33:06,073 --> 00:33:07,575
Yeah? How?

507
00:33:07,825 --> 00:33:10,536
First thing, you'll put a dollar
in my pocket, both of you.

508
00:33:13,372 --> 00:33:15,541
You want attorney-client privilege,
don't you?

509
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:18,795
So that everything you say
is strictly between us.

510
00:33:20,046 --> 00:33:21,881
I mean it. Put a dollar in my pocket.

511
00:33:22,089 --> 00:33:23,716
Come on, make it official.

512
00:33:24,717 --> 00:33:26,469
Come on, do it.

513
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:30,515
That's it, come on. Just a dollar.

514
00:33:34,727 --> 00:33:38,397
All right, now you, ski bum.
Come on. Give with the dollar.

515
00:33:39,065 --> 00:33:40,107
Go on.
-Be smart.

516
00:33:40,316 --> 00:33:41,776
What?

517
00:33:45,446 --> 00:33:47,240
All I got is a five.
-I'll take a five.

518
00:33:47,448 --> 00:33:51,035
Come on, already.
Come on. Be cool.

519
00:33:53,371 --> 00:33:55,456
Okay, you're now both
officially represented...

520
00:33:55,665 --> 00:33:57,250
...by Saul Goodman and Associates.

521
00:33:57,458 --> 00:34:01,838
Your secrets are safe with me
under threat of disbarment. All right?

522
00:34:02,255 --> 00:34:05,550
Take the ski mask off. I feel like I'm
talking to the Weather Underground.

523
00:34:07,468 --> 00:34:09,428
Just do it.

524
00:34:14,058 --> 00:34:17,436
Okay, so if a prison shanking
is completely off the table...

525
00:34:17,645 --> 00:34:18,896
And we're sure of that?

526
00:34:21,524 --> 00:34:23,025
No shanking!

527
00:34:25,027 --> 00:34:26,529
All right, all right.

528
00:34:27,155 --> 00:34:31,576
The way I see it is
somebody is going to prison.

529
00:34:35,496 --> 00:34:37,373
It's just a matter of who.

530
00:34:38,833 --> 00:34:42,086
All right. Lame-ass TV ads aside...

531
00:34:42,295 --> 00:34:45,798
...your lawyer here,
he cooked you up a pretty killer deal.

532
00:34:46,007 --> 00:34:47,258
Time served, no probation.

533
00:34:47,467 --> 00:34:50,803
It's pretty slick.
Couldn't believe the judge went for it.

534
00:34:51,721 --> 00:34:54,098
Don't get cocky.
You ain't home free yet.

535
00:34:54,307 --> 00:34:56,350
You don't give us
the name of your supplier...

536
00:34:56,559 --> 00:34:59,770
...you're going nowhere.
-The tough guy act is unnecessary.

537
00:34:59,979 --> 00:35:02,273
This young man
is cooperating fully.

538
00:35:02,482 --> 00:35:05,401
Is that right?
Yeah, you cooperating?

539
00:35:09,363 --> 00:35:12,241
Okay, let's start with a name.

540
00:35:14,702 --> 00:35:16,788
He just goes by Heisenberg.

541
00:35:17,330 --> 00:35:18,331
Heisenberg, huh?

542
00:35:19,707 --> 00:35:21,167
How old is this Heisenberg?

543
00:35:21,876 --> 00:35:25,671
Old. Like 50 or 70 or something.

544
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:28,007
Height?
-Average, I guess.

545
00:35:28,216 --> 00:35:30,092
Medium height, medium weight.

546
00:35:30,301 --> 00:35:33,304
What colour hair?
-No hair.

547
00:35:33,513 --> 00:35:35,139
Dude is balder than you.

548
00:35:37,350 --> 00:35:39,811
1963, James Edward Kilkelly...

549
00:35:40,019 --> 00:35:42,522
...is convicted of stealing
a vending machine.

550
00:35:42,730 --> 00:35:45,525
1975, breaking and entering.

551
00:35:45,733 --> 00:35:48,361
1982, grand theft auto.

552
00:35:48,569 --> 00:35:50,905
1984, armed robbery.

553
00:35:51,114 --> 00:35:55,451
1987, 1992. You get the idea.
And here he is today.

554
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:57,537
Better known as Jimmy In-'N-Out.

555
00:35:57,745 --> 00:36:03,251
City, state and federal, he's spent
44 of the last 58 years inside.

556
00:36:04,252 --> 00:36:06,712
Entire life behind bars.

557
00:36:07,213 --> 00:36:09,465
Jimmy provides
a very special service.

558
00:36:09,674 --> 00:36:12,510
For a price,
Jimmy will go to prison for you.

559
00:36:13,511 --> 00:36:17,223
On purpose?
The guy goes to prison on purpose?

560
00:36:18,141 --> 00:36:20,059
He's actually
more comfortable inside.

561
00:36:20,268 --> 00:36:22,687
The outside world
hasn't been too kind to him.

562
00:36:24,730 --> 00:36:26,732
Sometime during
the Clinton administration...

563
00:36:26,941 --> 00:36:31,070
...Jimmy figured out how he could
use his talents to turn a profit.

564
00:36:35,575 --> 00:36:40,371
So when does all this happen?
-It's already happening.

565
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:41,873
The buy is set for tomorrow.

566
00:36:42,081 --> 00:36:44,750
Cops bust Jimmy, Badger gets out,
everybody's happy...

567
00:36:44,959 --> 00:36:47,962
...and all it's gonna cost you
is 80 thousand and one pound...

568
00:36:48,171 --> 00:36:49,672
...of your finest meth.

569
00:36:54,302 --> 00:36:58,139
Eighty thousand dollars
for eight years of his life, huh?

570
00:36:58,347 --> 00:37:00,558
First of all,
he's not gonna do eight years.

571
00:37:00,766 --> 00:37:02,560
I'll represent him, and I guarantee...

572
00:37:02,768 --> 00:37:06,272
...there's gonna be some unexpected
problems with the prosecution's case.

573
00:37:06,481 --> 00:37:09,108
Secondly, he gets 30.
Fifty goes to me.

574
00:37:09,317 --> 00:37:12,361
You get 50? For what?
-For facilitating.

575
00:37:12,570 --> 00:37:15,239
Who's taking a bigger risk here?
He likes prison.

576
00:37:15,448 --> 00:37:17,450
You did bring the cash, didn't you?

577
00:37:17,658 --> 00:37:20,745
Look, if this option
is too expensive...

578
00:37:20,953 --> 00:37:24,373
...you can still always...Badger
in the chow line.

579
00:37:42,683 --> 00:37:44,769
Conscience gets expensive,
doesn't it?

580
00:38:02,203 --> 00:38:04,705
All right. There's our boy.

581
00:38:05,873 --> 00:38:08,167
Right on time.

582
00:38:24,851 --> 00:38:27,854
Go back.
-What? All right, all right, all right.

583
00:38:40,741 --> 00:38:44,370
So, what do you think?
They see us?

584
00:38:44,787 --> 00:38:46,664
No, man, I think we're good.

585
00:38:52,086 --> 00:38:54,172
Badger looks like
he's gonna throw up.

586
00:38:54,589 --> 00:38:56,048
Give me those back.

587
00:38:56,257 --> 00:38:58,217
Just give them to me.

588
00:38:58,885 --> 00:39:00,678
Oh, no.

589
00:39:01,262 --> 00:39:02,472
Where the hell is Jimmy?

590
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:04,682
Should've been here
10 minutes ago.

591
00:39:04,891 --> 00:39:09,604
You think Jimmy is actually for real?
A guy who wants to be in prison?

592
00:39:10,188 --> 00:39:12,190
There's more
than one kind of prison.

593
00:39:12,398 --> 00:39:14,233
What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

594
00:39:14,442 --> 00:39:16,903
There he is-Wait a minute.

595
00:39:17,111 --> 00:39:20,656
Oh, no, no, no.
-What? What? Let me see.

596
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:24,410
Who the hell is that?
-I don't know.

597
00:39:28,122 --> 00:39:31,083
Mr. Heisenberg, I presume.

598
00:39:32,126 --> 00:39:33,795
Time to move?

599
00:39:34,086 --> 00:39:36,130
Not till we see the exchange.

600
00:39:38,966 --> 00:39:41,969
No, no. Oh, shit!

601
00:39:42,178 --> 00:39:45,264
What?
-Now he shows.

602
00:39:48,768 --> 00:39:50,686
Okay, let's do this.

603
00:39:54,857 --> 00:39:56,192
No, no.

604
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,945
Oh, my God.
Jimmy is on the wrong bench. Crap!

605
00:39:59,153 --> 00:40:01,239
We're screwed!

606
00:40:01,447 --> 00:40:02,824
What are you doing?

607
00:40:03,032 --> 00:40:05,159
Hey, what are you doing?

608
00:40:09,247 --> 00:40:11,124
I don't get it. What's the holdup?

609
00:40:21,843 --> 00:40:23,136
Where's the stuff, man?

610
00:40:23,344 --> 00:40:25,471
Where are we going?
-Just shut up.

611
00:40:31,352 --> 00:40:32,562
Get out. Go stop him.

612
00:40:32,770 --> 00:40:35,189
The DEA is right there.
If they see me, we're screwed.

613
00:40:35,398 --> 00:40:36,899
Get out. I'll do something.

614
00:40:37,108 --> 00:40:39,110
What?
-Just go!

615
00:40:52,039 --> 00:40:54,167
Hank, I thought that was you.

616
00:40:54,375 --> 00:40:55,960
Schrader, I'm blocked.

617
00:40:56,169 --> 00:40:58,921
Walt, not a good time.
-How you doing? You feeling okay?

618
00:40:59,130 --> 00:41:00,131
Schrader, I'm blocked.

619
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:02,842
We're working.
You gotta get out of here.

620
00:41:03,050 --> 00:41:06,387
Working? Oh, like DEA working?
-Schrader, we're missing it. Schrader.

621
00:41:06,596 --> 00:41:08,639
Is something going down?

622
00:41:10,892 --> 00:41:13,436
Wrong guy, wrong guy.
Other bench.

623
00:41:20,234 --> 00:41:21,360
Walt, Walt.

624
00:41:21,569 --> 00:41:23,696
Walter, move your ass now.
-Okay.

625
00:41:23,905 --> 00:41:25,698
Listen, I'll just go, leave you alone.

626
00:41:25,907 --> 00:41:28,701
We'll talk about it later. Just floor it.
-Should I back up?

627
00:41:28,910 --> 00:41:30,328
Go that way.
-Forward is better?

628
00:41:30,536 --> 00:41:32,371
I'll be out of the way there.
Okay, okay.

629
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:35,041
I'm sorry, all right? I'm sorry.

630
00:41:35,249 --> 00:41:37,835
I'll leave you alone.
-We'll talk later. Just go.

631
00:41:38,586 --> 00:41:41,464
Where'd he go?
Where the hell did he go?

632
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:46,677
Oh, wait. Wait, wait, wait. Got him.

633
00:41:53,935 --> 00:41:56,312
Looks like it's going down.
-Take him.

634
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:07,323
Freeze! Hey, right there.
Don't move.

635
00:42:09,742 --> 00:42:11,160
Come on, let's get him up.

636
00:42:20,962 --> 00:42:22,630
Jesus!

637
00:42:23,631 --> 00:42:25,466
I think they bought it.

638
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:30,263
<i>Absolutely.</i>

639
00:42:30,471 --> 00:42:33,850
Textbook bust, sir. Yes, sir.

640
00:42:34,058 --> 00:42:36,602
Looks like we got a full pound
of the blue stuff.

641
00:42:36,811 --> 00:42:41,566
Oh, and Heisenberg's real name?
James Kilkelly.

642
00:42:42,859 --> 00:42:46,946
Thank you. Thank you very much.
It was my pleasure.

643
00:43:13,681 --> 00:43:15,016
Hey.

644
00:43:16,017 --> 00:43:18,519
You weren't home,
so I let the delivery guys in.

645
00:43:18,728 --> 00:43:22,148
I hope that's okay.
-Absolutely.

646
00:43:31,532 --> 00:43:33,701
So you bought a bed.

647
00:43:35,161 --> 00:43:36,287
Yeah.

648
00:43:36,871 --> 00:43:38,581
What is that, a king?

649
00:43:41,083 --> 00:43:42,668
Pillow top?

650
00:44:18,871 --> 00:44:22,792
Oh, my God.
You really are a chemistry teacher.

651
00:44:27,755 --> 00:44:29,257
You mind?

652
00:44:33,344 --> 00:44:35,555
I was terrible at chemistry.

653
00:44:35,763 --> 00:44:38,391
I'm more of a humanities guy.

654
00:44:38,599 --> 00:44:41,185
How did you find me?
-We should talk about that.

655
00:44:41,394 --> 00:44:45,731
It should be much, much harder
for people to track you down.

656
00:44:45,940 --> 00:44:47,567
My Pl charged me for three hours...

657
00:44:47,775 --> 00:44:50,736
...so I seriously doubt
it took him more than one.

658
00:44:53,656 --> 00:44:56,784
So this is, what, blackmail?

659
00:44:56,993 --> 00:44:58,703
Walter, I'm your lawyer.

660
00:44:58,911 --> 00:45:03,332
Anything you say to me
is totally privileged.

661
00:45:03,541 --> 00:45:06,085
I'm not in the shakedown racket.

662
00:45:06,294 --> 00:45:08,713
I'm a lawyer. Even drug dealers
need lawyers, right?

663
00:45:08,921 --> 00:45:12,049
Especially drug dealers.

664
00:45:12,467 --> 00:45:16,512
So, what, you're just doing this
out of the kindness of your heart?

665
00:45:17,054 --> 00:45:20,349
Come on.
Have you seen my hourly rate?

666
00:45:21,642 --> 00:45:23,603
By the way,
where do you keep the money?

667
00:45:23,811 --> 00:45:28,107
Is it in your mattress? Is it in a jelly jar
buried in the side yard?

668
00:45:28,316 --> 00:45:31,277
This kid Mayhew may be the first
of your guys to get picked up...

669
00:45:31,486 --> 00:45:32,779
...but he won't be the last.

670
00:45:32,987 --> 00:45:36,532
And if I can find you,
how far behind can the cops be?

671
00:45:36,741 --> 00:45:38,159
I don't understand.

672
00:45:38,367 --> 00:45:41,245
What exactly are you
offering to do for me?

673
00:45:42,747 --> 00:45:45,792
What did Tom Hagen
do for Vito Corleone?

674
00:45:46,209 --> 00:45:49,295
I'm no Vito Corleone.

675
00:45:49,504 --> 00:45:52,256
No shit. Right now, you're Fredo.

676
00:45:52,465 --> 00:45:53,966
But with some sound advice...

677
00:45:54,175 --> 00:45:56,552
...and the proper introductions,
who knows?

678
00:45:56,761 --> 00:45:58,721
I'll tell you,
you've got the right product.

679
00:45:58,930 --> 00:46:01,682
Anything that gets the DEA's panties
in this big a bunch...

680
00:46:01,891 --> 00:46:03,559
...you're on to something special.

681
00:46:03,768 --> 00:46:08,147
And I would like to be
a small and silent part of it.

682
00:46:10,733 --> 00:46:11,776
Food for thought, yeah?

683
00:46:16,989 --> 00:46:21,661
So if you wanna make more money
and keep the money that you make...

684
00:46:22,954 --> 00:46:24,997
...better call Saul!
