00:00:08,475 --> 00:00:12,571
Spin-off! Is there any word more
thrilling to the human soul?

2
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:14,647
Hi, I'm Troy McClure.

3
00:00:14,748 --> 00:00:20,448
You may remember me from such TV spin-offs
as <i>Son of Sanford and Son</i> and <i>After Mannix.</i>

4
00:00:20,553 --> 00:00:22,748
I'm here at the Museum
ofTV and Television...

5
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:25,484
with a real treat
for <i>Simpsons</i> fans, if any...

6
00:00:25,592 --> 00:00:29,892
because tonight we present
<i>The Simpsons Spin-Off Showcase.</i>

7
00:00:29,996 --> 00:00:32,897
<i>- ## [Theme]</i>
<i>- [Applause]</i>

8
00:00:41,574 --> 00:00:44,771
Not long ago, the Fox network approached
the producers of <i>The Simpsons...</i>

9
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:46,778
with a simple request-

10
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:50,611
35 new shows to fill a few holes
in their programming lineup.

11
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:52,617
<i>That's a pretty daunting task.</i>

12
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,983
And the producers weren't up to it.

13
00:00:55,088 --> 00:00:58,114
Instead, they churned out
three <i>Simpsons</i> spin-offs...

14
00:00:58,224 --> 00:01:02,684
transplanting already popular characters
into new locales and situations.

15
00:01:02,796 --> 00:01:04,957
First up, a gritty crime drama...

16
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:07,829
starring Springfield's
beloved Police Chief Wiggum.

17
00:01:07,934 --> 00:01:09,834
Keep at least one eye open.

18
00:01:09,936 --> 00:01:13,372
'Cause his best friends, the Simpsons,
just might pop in to wish him luck.

19
00:01:13,473 --> 00:01:15,532
Let's us wish him luck too.

20
00:01:15,642 --> 00:01:17,610
Good luck, Wiggum!

22
00:01:51,811 --> 00:01:55,042
Ah, New Orleans.

Old... Swampy.

24

I still don't understand, Clancy.

25
00:02:01,754 --> 00:02:04,416
Why give up your job
as a small-town police chief...

26
00:02:04,524 --> 00:02:06,651
to set up a detective shop
in New Orleans?

27
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:08,659
Oh, lots of reasons, I suppose.

28
00:02:08,761 --> 00:02:10,922
Got kicked off the force
for one thing.

29
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:13,396
- For massive corruption.
- For massive- Exactly.

30
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:17,937
Yeah. As for me, I was born and bred here
on the mean streets of New Orleans.

31
00:02:18,037 --> 00:02:21,438
Oh, sure, I left briefly to take
that principal's job in Springfield.

32
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:24,977
But, in my heart, I've- I've always
been a small-time hustler.

33
00:02:25,078 --> 00:02:29,242
I know. That's precisely why I hired you
as my legman, Skinny Boy.

34
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:33,979
I want you to put the word out. Chief Wiggum
is here to clean up this crime dump.

35
00:02:35,755 --> 00:02:37,655
Bleh!

36
00:02:37,757 --> 00:02:39,748
Looks like you've already
got an enemy, Chief.

37
00:02:39,859 --> 00:02:43,386
You know, folks around here
don't much care for law and order types.

38
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:46,056
Is that right? Well, maybe
they'll change their minds...

39
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:49,602
once I arrest them
for throwing skulls all over my floor.

40
00:02:49,702 --> 00:02:51,693
Hmm.

41
00:02:54,908 --> 00:02:58,844
Oh, man, what a day.
It's no cakewalk being a single parent...

42
00:02:58,945 --> 00:03:03,279
juggling a career and a family
like so many juggling balls.

43
00:03:03,383 --> 00:03:07,217
- Two, I suppose.
- Daddy, these rubber pants are hot.

44
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:10,289
You wear 'em
until you learn, Son.

45
00:03:16,663 --> 00:03:19,860
- I guarantee!
- Will you stop saying that?

46
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:22,764
So, Skinner, who do you figure threw
that skull through my window?

47
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:24,769
What's the word on the street?

48
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:28,898
Well, to be honest, Chief,
I haven't lived in New Orleans for 42 years.

49
00:03:29,008 --> 00:03:32,500
Although, uh, according to an article
I read in <i>Parade</i> magazine-

50
00:03:32,612 --> 00:03:36,742
- Mm-hmm.
- a criminal by the name of
"Big Daddy" runs this town.

51
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:40,478
Big Daddy, eh?
Well, he won't feel so big...

52
00:03:40,587 --> 00:03:43,420
if he messes with
Chief Wiggum, P.I. again.

53
00:03:43,523 --> 00:03:45,855
Which I sincerely doubt he will.

The next one won't be corked.

Listen up, Big Daddy! You don't scare me!
I'm three steps ahead of you!

<i>- [Skinner] Oh, Chief, your boy's been kidnapped.</i>

61
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:39,040

Big Daddy! What have you
done with my boy, Daddy?

71
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:13,438
Ah, the boy is fine, so far.
I taught him to play the spoons.

- [Dial Tone]
- Huh.

75
00:05:21,788 --> 00:05:24,484
Sounded like some sort of party
going on in the background.

76
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:26,524
Are there any parties today, Skinner?

77
00:05:26,626 --> 00:05:28,753
Nah, it's not really a party town.

Well, golly, I'd love to chat,

Ah, it's not rented, Chief.
It's stolen.

104
00:07:23,643 --> 00:07:26,908
That's the Louisiana Governor's Mansion.
It's been missing for eight months.

Could <i>The Simpsons</i> ever have maintained
its popularity without Moe the bartender?

Let's hope so, because Moe's
leaving to do his own sitcom.

But don't panic.
He's taking a familiar sidekick with him.

And his best friend Homer might just pop in
to wish him luck. Let's take a peek.

Well-Ahh- I better go.

128
