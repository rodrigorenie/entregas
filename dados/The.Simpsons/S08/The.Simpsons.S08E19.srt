00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:20,186
Sex Cauldron? I thought
they closed that place down!

322
00:19:20,292 --> 00:19:22,192
What are you people
talking about?

323
00:19:22,294 --> 00:19:25,957
My child told me you two were
having sex in the school janitor's closet.

324
00:19:26,064 --> 00:19:29,090
- You know, making babies!
- Yes! Illicit sex!

325
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:31,260
Doing "it!" "It!" "It!"

326
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:33,429
Sordid, public,
sexual congress!

327
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:36,838
This is absurd! I did not have
relations in that closet!

328
00:19:36,942 --> 00:19:40,241
And the fact is, I haven't-
[Gasps]

329
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:42,313
Uh-

330
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:46,407
Yes?

331
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:48,543
Seymour, I think
you'd better tell them.

332
00:19:48,654 --> 00:19:51,088
It's the only way
to clear our names.

333
00:19:53,825 --> 00:19:56,726
[Clicks Tongue, Exhales]
Well, everyone...

334
00:19:56,828 --> 00:19:59,729
the fact is, I haven't
ever had relations.

335
00:20:00,766 --> 00:20:02,734
I am a virgin.

336
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:08,605
- Ha-ha!
- [Muttering]

337
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:15,544
- Hey! Does this mean that
Mrs. Krabappel is a virgin too?
<i>- [Nelson] Ha!</i>

338
00:20:15,647 --> 00:20:19,447
Well, Seymour, it's clear
you've been falsely accused...

339
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:22,748
because no one, anywhere, ever...

340
00:20:22,854 --> 00:20:26,153
would pretend to be
a 44-year-old virgin.

341
00:20:26,258 --> 00:20:28,158
Oh, that's for sure!

342
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:30,626
I'm inclined to agree.

343
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:33,027
Ach! I'll never look
at him the same again.

344
00:20:33,131 --> 00:20:35,031
That was more than
I wanted to know.

345
00:20:35,133 --> 00:20:37,294
[Clearing Throat]
Okay, well, um-

346
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:41,862
Edna, Seymour, in light
of these, uh, revelations...

347
00:20:41,974 --> 00:20:44,534
I suppose we overreacted.

348
00:20:44,643 --> 00:20:48,238
- Do we have our jobs back?
- What? Oh, yes, yes, yes. Sure.

349
00:20:48,347 --> 00:20:51,248
Just, uh, you know, keep
the lewdness to a minimum.

350
00:20:55,487 --> 00:20:58,479
<i>[Whispering, Indistinct]</i>

351
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:01,753
I'm outta here!
Skinny, Crabby, catch you later.

352
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:04,954
Uh, hold on, Bart.
May we have a word with you?

353
00:21:05,063 --> 00:21:07,497
We want to thank you for helping us
through a difficult period.

354
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:12,036
Oh! No problemo. So, I guess now you'll be
getting married or something, huh?

355
00:21:12,137 --> 00:21:15,368
Well, actually, Seymour and I
have decided to break up.

356
00:21:15,474 --> 00:21:18,068
- Huh?
- We can't continue on like this...

357
00:21:18,176 --> 00:21:20,076
trying to build a private relationship
in public-

358
00:21:20,178 --> 00:21:23,306
the whole town watching our every move
with a fine-tooth comb-

359
00:21:23,415 --> 00:21:27,146
Mm-hmm. I'm used to humiliation.
But not in front of a crowd that size.

360
00:21:27,252 --> 00:21:29,413
Oh, but you seemed
like such a good couple.

361
00:21:29,521 --> 00:21:32,217
Bart, when you get a little older...

362
00:21:32,324 --> 00:21:34,815
you're going to learn that
sometimes romances don't turn out...

363
00:21:34,926 --> 00:21:36,826
exactly the way
you'd like them to.

364
00:21:36,928 --> 00:21:40,125
Hmm.

365
00:21:40,232 --> 00:21:43,030
That's why I love
elementary school, Edna.

366
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:46,104
The children believe
anything you tell them.

367
00:21:46,204 --> 00:21:48,434
[Laughing]

368
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:51,441
[Both Laughing]

369
00:21:51,543 --> 00:21:54,444
<i>- [Champagne Cork Pops]</i>
<i>- [Edna] Whoo! Oh, Seymour!</i>

370
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:42,660
- [Murmuring]
- Shh!
