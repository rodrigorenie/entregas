The first one

Admiral Byrd had just
reached the Pole...

of the Three Stooges.

I guess he won the argument,
but I walked away with the turnips.

The following morning, I resigned
my commission in the Coast Guard.

there was civil war in Spain.

Solitude never hurt anyone.

262
00:14:36,575 --> 00:14:38,475
Emily Dickinson lived alone...

263
00:14:38,577 --> 00:14:43,810
and she wrote some of the most beautiful poetry
the world has ever known.

I'm tired of being an issue, Bart.

Maybe everyone would be better off

272
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:23,885
But if you quit,
it'd be like an expert knot-tier...

Don't do that.

Well, cadets,
it's been a great year.

280
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:50,548
You've all worked very hard, developing

My killing teacher

But these skills are nothing
without courage and stamina.

283
00:15:56,689 --> 00:15:59,920
Traditionally, the academy
tested these virtues...

284
00:16:00,025 --> 00:16:03,791

Geez! [Sighs]

332
00:18:29,842 --> 00:18:32,310
Good job, Simpson.
Although that's more cursing...

333
00:18:32,411 --> 00:18:34,879
than I like to hear
from a cadet in peacetime.

334

[All Congratulating]

335
00:18:36,982 --> 00:18:40,975
Last up-
Simpson, Lisa!

<i>[Jeering]</i>

337
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:57,632
What's the matter?
Are you scared? Are you scared, huh?

338
00:18:57,736 --> 00:19:00,705
Well, at least
they're talking to me.

339
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:07,006
- [Gasps]
- [Bird Squawks]

340

[Straining]

341
00:19:17,022 --> 00:19:20,253
- Whoa!
- [Gasps]

342
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:25,820
If only I were in Springfield,
all my friends would be cheering me on.

343
00:19:25,931 --> 00:19:28,923
Oh, God, I'm delirious.

[Chanting]
Drop! Drop! Drop!

347
00:19:44,816 --> 00:19:47,614
You can make it, Lisa.
I know you can!

348
00:19:47,719 --> 00:19:51,018
<i>Come on. I know you can do it.</i>
<i>Just get your hands back on the rope.</i>

349
00:19:51,123 --> 00:19:55,492
<i>It's just a little further. Come on.</i>
<i>Just a little bit more. You're doing great.</i>

350
00:19:55,594 --> 00:19:59,121
That's it. Come on.
Just a little bit more.

351
00:19:59,231 --> 00:20:01,665
I know you can do it.
I believe in you.

352
00:20:01,767 --> 00:20:03,826
[Straining]

353
00:20:06,905 --> 00:20:09,430
Yes!

354
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:11,441
You thought I couldn't,
but I could. I did.

355
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:14,842
And I could do it again.
Let's do it again!

356
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:17,916
Lisa, it's over. You made it.
You can put your arms down.

357
00:20:18,016 --> 00:20:20,450
I can't. They're stuck.

358
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:24,010
We're gonna make your life a living hell
for the rest of the semester.

359
00:20:24,122 --> 00:20:27,148
But graduation's
in three hours.

360
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:29,420
We better go change.

361
00:20:29,528 --> 00:20:31,826
<i>- ## [Fanfare]</i>
- The wars of the future...

362
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:34,899
will not be fought
on a battlefield or at sea.

363
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,230
They will be fought in space.

364
00:20:37,336 --> 00:20:39,861
Or possibly on top
of a very tall mountain.

365
00:20:39,972 --> 00:20:44,602
In either case, most of the actual fighting
will be done by small robots.

366
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:49,170
And as you go forth today,
remember always your duty is clear-

367
00:20:49,281 --> 00:20:53,377
To build and maintain
those robots. Thank you.

368
00:20:53,485 --> 00:20:55,680
[Cheering]

369
00:20:57,956 --> 00:21:02,620
Well, Bart, did you make sure
to return all the guns?

370
00:21:02,728 --> 00:21:05,026
Sir, yes, sir!
Luckily I am now trained...

371
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:07,655
in six additional forms
of unarmed combat, sir!

372
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:10,826
Well, he's got more confidence.

373
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:15,635
Uh, yeah. I've always said the boy
could use more confidence.

374
00:21:15,741 --> 00:21:18,938
Lisa, before you go...

375
00:21:19,044 --> 00:21:21,274
I want to present you with this.

376
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:24,941
A medal?
Thank you, sir.

377
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:28,247
[Grunts]

378
00:21:28,353 --> 00:21:32,847
"For satisfactory completion
of the second grade." Oh.

379
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:37,452
<i>Well, kids, we're so proud</i>
<i>of the way you completed military school...</i>

380
00:21:37,562 --> 00:21:41,589
we thought this time
we'd take you to Disneyland for real.

381
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,725
[Both]
Yea!

382
00:21:48,607 --> 00:21:51,770
[Both]
Hey!
