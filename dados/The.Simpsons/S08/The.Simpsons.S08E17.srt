<i>Springfield has stolen your idea.</i>

14
00:01:03,863 --> 00:01:08,391
I'm walking on the waterfront, once the center
of a thriving squid-gutting industry...

15
00:01:08,501 --> 00:01:12,631
now abandoned by all but a few
longshoremen and allied tradespeople.

But the decades of rot will end...

17
00:01:14,874 --> 00:01:17,342

of the South Street Squidport...

18
00:01:17,444 --> 00:01:19,412

24
00:01:34,694 --> 00:01:38,755
Well, I just remembered they're having a big
one down at the waterfront this weekend.

25

You didn't remember that.
You just saw it on TV.

The important thing is
I didn't imagine it.

I can't get enough
of <i>The Babysitter Twins.</i>

28
00:01:48,508 --> 00:01:51,341
They arrested the counterfeiters,
rescued the president...

29
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:53,674
and made four dollars!

30
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,248
I love everything
about the world of babysitting-

31
00:01:56,349 --> 00:01:59,512
the responsibility,
the obligation, the pressure.

Why hasn't anyone called?

47
00:02:46,866 --> 00:02:50,324
Maybe people don't want
an eight-year-old babysitter, honey.

48
00:02:50,436 --> 00:02:54,236
Parents need to be sure their sitter
can handle anything that might happen.

49
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,308
That's why they hire teenagers.

50

Oh, I don't know, Lisa. You're awfully young,
and the boys can be a handful.

66

Todd's been pinching everyone lately.

67
00:03:51,364 --> 00:03:54,925

Yes, he had a brother robot named Rod,

Good night, Lisa.

You made all that money for sitting around

There's a lot more to it than that, Bart.
I don't just babysit.

108

What the hell is that?

<i>- [Man] I don't believe it!</i>

341

She's murdered her brother!

342

- And she's trying to dump the body in a harbor!
- Well, duh!

343
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:20,716
And as a grim finale, she intends
to drown that poor caged baby!

<i>Where am I?</i>

345
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:27,984
- And she's on drugs!
- Give me the drugs, Lisa.

346
00:20:28,093 --> 00:20:30,857
Dad, I'm not on drugs!
I was just trying-

347
00:20:30,963 --> 00:20:35,400
[Gasps] His arm!
Oh, my special little guy! Are you okay?

348
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:39,869
Hmm. Dislocated shoulder,
bump on the noggin.

349
00:20:39,972 --> 00:20:41,940
My diagnosis?

350
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:45,999
Rather nasty fall
caused by bad babysitting.

352
00:20:53,852 --> 00:20:57,185
- Hey, Bart. How's your arm?
- It's all right.

353
00:20:57,289 --> 00:21:02,090
I was hoping they'd give me one of those
steel claws, but what are you gonna do?

354
00:21:02,194 --> 00:21:06,255
I'm- I'm sorry
I was such a jerk last night.

355
00:21:06,365 --> 00:21:09,266
Guess I sort of ruined
your babysitting business.

356
00:21:09,368 --> 00:21:14,135
Yeah, well, that's okay.
I can always sell seeds.

357

Lisa, I'm glad I reached you.

Are you available to babysit tonight?

362
00:21:26,818 --> 00:21:29,685
Aren't you afraid I might take drugs
and injure your children?

363
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:32,916
Yes, that is a concern,
but it's so hard to find a sitter...

364
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:34,993

Didn't you hear
I almost killed my brother?

You did? Just a minute.
