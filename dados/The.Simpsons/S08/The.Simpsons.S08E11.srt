[Swallows]
In those words? Yes.

335
00:18:46,992 --> 00:18:48,289
Oh, it just sickens me!

336
00:18:48,393 --> 00:18:49,724
- How could you do this to someone you love?
- How could I not?

337
00:18:49,828 --> 00:18:52,126
I saw you pouring your heart and soul
into this business and getting nowhere.

338
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:56,963
I saw you desperately trying
to cram one more salty treat...

339
00:18:57,069 --> 00:18:58,969
into America's already-bloated
snack hole.

340
00:18:59,071 --> 00:19:00,971
<i>So I did what I could.</i>

341
00:19:01,073 --> 00:19:03,303
I did what any loving husband
would do-

342
00:19:03,408 --> 00:19:05,933
I reached out
to some violent mobsters.

343
00:19:06,044 --> 00:19:10,071
Oh, Homer. I know you were trying
to shield me from failure.

344
00:19:10,182 --> 00:19:15,245
But this is my business. And the Mafia's
not getting one cent of my money!

345
00:19:15,354 --> 00:19:18,846
- So what are we going to do?
- We're going to do what we do every day.

346
00:19:18,957 --> 00:19:20,925
We're going to make pretzels.

347
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:27,855
[Ticking]

348
00:19:27,966 --> 00:19:31,424
There. That's the last one.

349
00:19:31,537 --> 00:19:33,732
[Ticking]

350
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,808
[Whimpers]

351
00:19:37,943 --> 00:19:40,002
<i>- [Loud Knock]</i>
- [Both Scream]

352
00:19:43,649 --> 00:19:46,413
I had that dream again!

353
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:49,544
Oh, thank God.
It's only Grampa.

354
00:19:49,655 --> 00:19:52,283
<i>- [Knocking]</i>
- Now what?

355
00:19:52,391 --> 00:19:54,586
- [Gasps]
- [Gasps]

356
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:58,322
Sorry we're late.
Could we have the money now?

357
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:00,523
The answer is no.

358
00:20:00,632 --> 00:20:02,930
I'm afraid I must insist.

359
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:04,935
You see, my wife...

360
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:08,006
she has been most vocal
on the subject of the pretzel monies:

361
00:20:08,106 --> 00:20:10,336
"Where's the money?
When are you going to get the money?

362
00:20:10,442 --> 00:20:12,342
Why aren't you getting the money now?"

363
00:20:12,444 --> 00:20:15,880
And so on.
So, please, da money.

364
00:20:15,981 --> 00:20:18,541
You heard her. She said no.

365
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:21,585
Legs, Louie.
Advance on them.

366
00:20:22,955 --> 00:20:24,923
<i>[Woman]</i>
<i>There they are!</i>

367
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:32,123
Well, well. If it isn't Marge Simpson
and her gangland cronies.

368
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:35,428
Your goon squad certainly gave you
the edge in the mobile snack business.

369
00:20:35,534 --> 00:20:38,094
But I'm afraid we've
outdone you once again.

370
00:20:38,203 --> 00:20:41,104
Hiroshi, Yukio.

371
00:20:41,206 --> 00:20:43,231
<i>Perhaps you've heard</i>
<i>of the Yakuza...</i>

372
00:20:43,342 --> 00:20:45,902
<i>the poison fists</i>
<i>of the Pacific Rim?</i>

373
00:20:46,011 --> 00:20:47,911
TheJapanese Mafia?

374
00:20:48,013 --> 00:20:51,676
They'll kill ya five times
before ya hit the ground.

375
00:20:51,783 --> 00:20:54,377
[Men Murmuring]

376
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:01,159
- [Men Shouting]
- [Punches Landing]

377
00:21:03,795 --> 00:21:05,922
- [Screaming]
- Hey.

378
00:21:06,031 --> 00:21:07,794
[Punches Landing]

379
00:21:07,899 --> 00:21:10,026
Take that. Take this.

380
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:13,604
Come here, you little squirt.

381
00:21:13,705 --> 00:21:16,936
- [Fighting Sounds Continue]
- Homie, maybe we should go inside.

382
00:21:17,042 --> 00:21:19,943
But, Marge, that little guy
hasn't done anything yet.

383
00:21:20,045 --> 00:21:22,639
<i>Look at him.</i>
<i>He's gonna do something...</i>

384
00:21:22,748 --> 00:21:24,613
and you know
it's gonna be good.

385
00:21:24,716 --> 00:21:26,650
<i>[Karate Yell]</i>

386
00:21:26,752 --> 00:21:29,619
<i>- [Thudding]</i>
- Aw.

387
00:21:31,356 --> 00:21:35,588
You must hate me, Marge.
Every time I try to help, I just fail miserably.

388
00:21:35,694 --> 00:21:37,958
<i>Oh, I don't hate you for failing.</i>

389
00:21:38,063 --> 00:21:40,190
I love you for trying.

390
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:43,291
[Yawns]
What's going on outside?

391
00:21:43,402 --> 00:21:46,803
Oh, it's just a mob war.
Go back to sleep, honey.

392
00:21:46,905 --> 00:21:48,873
<i>[Punch Landing]</i>

393
00:21:49,908 --> 00:21:51,967
Forgiveness, please.

394
00:22:40,158 --> 00:22:42,126
- [Murmuring]
- Shh!
