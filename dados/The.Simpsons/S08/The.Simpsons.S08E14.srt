It is so simple, you egghead writers
would've never thought of it.

94
00:05:28,728 --> 00:05:32,289
What we need is...
a new character!

95
00:05:32,398 --> 00:05:34,730
One that today's kids
can relate to!

96
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:38,360
Are you absolutely sure
that's wise, sir?

97
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:40,905
I mean, I don't want to sound
pretentious here...

98
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:43,237
but Itchy and Scratchy
comprise a dramaturgical dyad.

Hey, this ain't art!
It's business!

100
00:05:45,745 --> 00:05:48,646
What do ya got in mind?
Sexy broad? Gangster octopus?

101
00:05:48,748 --> 00:05:51,945
No. No. The animal

Isn't that a tad predictable?

00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:03,493
In your dreams. We're talking
the original dog from hell.

106
00:06:03,596 --> 00:06:05,621
You mean Cerberus?

107
00:06:05,732 --> 00:06:08,667

He's edgy.
He's in your face.

109

You've heard the expression
"let's get busy."

110
00:06:13,306 --> 00:06:16,434
Well, this is a dog
who gets "biz-zay."

111
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:18,567
Consistently and thoroughly.

112
00:06:18,678 --> 00:06:20,805
- So he's proactive, huh?
- Oh, God, yes.

113
00:06:20,913 --> 00:06:23,677
We're talking about
a totally outrageous paradigm.

114
00:06:23,783 --> 00:06:26,946
Excuse me, but
"proactive" and "paradigm"-

115
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:30,750
aren't these just buzzwords that
dumb people use to sound important?

116
00:06:30,857 --> 00:06:33,758
Not that I'm accusing you
of anything like that.

117
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,828
- I'm fired, aren't I?
- Oh, yes.

118
00:06:35,928 --> 00:06:39,056
The rest of you writers start thinking up
a name for this funky dog.

119
00:06:39,165 --> 00:06:42,100
I don't know. Something
along the lines of, say, Poochie.

120
00:06:42,201 --> 00:06:45,398
- Only more proactive.
- Yeah!

121
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:47,964

- So, Poochie okay with everybody?

122
00:06:54,013 --> 00:06:55,480
- Yeah.
- Yeah, you know, it's good.

123
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:56,980
<i>No, no, no.</i>

124
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,711
He was supposed
to have attitude!

125
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:02,379
Um, wh-wh-what
do you mean exactly?

126
00:07:02,488 --> 00:07:07,289
Oh, you know, attitude!
Attitude! Uh, sunglasses!

127
00:07:07,393 --> 00:07:10,089
Can we put him in more
of a hip-hop context?

128
00:07:10,196 --> 00:07:14,189
Forget context. He's gotta be a surfer.
Give me a nice schmear of surfer.

129
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:18,669
I feel we should
"rastafy" him by 10% or so.

130
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:26,841
Hmm. I think he needs
a little more attitude.

131
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:30,006
<i>- Oh, yeah, bingo! There it is right there!</i>
<i>- Yeah, that works.</i>

00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:32,016
<i>- That's it.</i>
<i>- I love it.</i>

133
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:37,318
Hey, Lise, look. They're adding
a new character to <i>Itchy and Scratchy.</i>

134
00:07:37,423 --> 00:07:39,323
Poochie the Dog?

135
00:07:39,425 --> 00:07:43,862
Adding a new character is often
a desperate attempt to boost low ratings.

136
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:46,022
Yo, yo.
How's it hangin', everybody?

137
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:48,362

You should try out, Dad.
You have a funny voice.

- Haven't you ever listened to
yourself on a tape recorder?

Oh, I don't like having
such a hilarious voice.

148
00:08:18,965 --> 00:08:21,763
That hilarious voice
could be your ticket to stardom.

[Laughs] What were you guys smokin'
when you came up with that?

151
00:08:34,947 --> 00:08:38,906
We were eating rotisserie chicken.
Can you just read the line, please?

152
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:43,421
Ruff, ruff. I'm Poochie,
the rockin' dog.

153
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:47,186
You're perfect! In fact,
you're better than perfect!

154
00:08:47,293 --> 00:08:49,625
Next to you,
perfection is crap!

155
00:08:49,729 --> 00:08:53,460
Ruff, ruff. I'm Poochie,

Hi. I'm Troy McClure. You may
remember me from such cartoons as...

You're even better than this guy.

- Take a hike, you bum.

[Clears Throat] Ruff, ruff.
I'm Poochie, the rockin' dog.

161
00:09:11,183 --> 00:09:14,675
Now, that's just bad. You got no attitude,
you're barely outrageous...

162
00:09:14,787 --> 00:09:18,518
and I don't know what you're in,
but it's not my face.

163

No. They only paid me
to say it once.

185
00:10:29,161 --> 00:10:31,994

on the soundtrack. Cheap bastards.

- Uh, I guess. Is this episode going on the air live?

187
00:10:36,335 --> 00:10:39,395
No, Homer. Very few cartoons
are broadcast live.

188

Hi. Question for Miss Bellamy.

190
00:10:56,322 --> 00:11:00,452
In episode 2F09, when Itchy plays
Scratchy's skeleton like a xylophone...

191
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:02,993
he strikes the same rib
twice in succession...

192
00:11:03,095 --> 00:11:05,996
yet he produces
two clearly different tones.

193
00:11:06,098 --> 00:11:09,363
I mean, what are we-
to believe that this is some sort of a-

194
00:11:09,468 --> 00:11:12,562
[Chuckles]
a magic xylophone or something?

195
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:15,300
Boy, I really hope somebody
got fired for that blunder.

196
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:19,970
- Uh, well, uh-
- I'll field this one. Let me ask you a question.

197
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,946
Why would a man whose shirt
says "genius at work"...

198
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:26,041
spend all of his time watching
a children's cartoon show?

325
00:18:55,234 --> 00:18:59,193
Forget it, Homer! We can do this show
without you if we have to.

326
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:02,933
- But not without me.
- Oh, geez!

327
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:06,101
Let him try the new lines.

328
00:19:06,211 --> 00:19:10,170
All right. All right.
We'll try them. Action.

329
00:19:10,282 --> 00:19:14,184
[Itchy's Voice] Hi, Poochie. You look
like you've got something to say.

330
00:19:14,286 --> 00:19:18,120
- Do you?
- Yes, I certainly do.

331
00:19:18,223 --> 00:19:20,123
Hello there, Itchy.

332
00:19:20,225 --> 00:19:24,286
I know there's a lot of people who don't
like me and wish I would go away...

333
00:19:24,396 --> 00:19:27,092
and I think we got off on the wrong foot.

334
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:30,896
I know I can come off a little proactive,
and for that I'm sorry.

335
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:36,464
<i>But if everyone could find a place in their</i>
<i>hearts for the little dog nobody wanted...</i>

336
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:38,566
I know we can make 'em laugh...

337
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:42,579
and cry till we grow old together.

338
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:44,740
And... cut.

339
00:19:56,929 --> 00:19:59,591
Now, kids, I know you loved
the old Poochie...

340
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:03,828
<i>but the new one's gonna be</i>
<i>better than 10 Super Bowls!</i>

341
00:20:03,936 --> 00:20:06,302
I don't wanna oversell it.
Judge for yourself.

342
00:20:08,006 --> 00:20:10,998
[Screams]
Well, look who's here.

343
00:20:11,109 --> 00:20:14,977
Hi, Poochie! You look like
you've got something to say.

344
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:18,413
- Do you?
- Yes, I certainly do.

345
00:20:18,517 --> 00:20:21,714
[Man's Voice]
I have to go now. My planet needs me.

346
00:20:23,822 --> 00:20:25,756
## [Organ]

347
00:20:25,857 --> 00:20:28,417
<i>Wow! Poochie came</i>
<i>from another planet?</i>

348
00:20:28,527 --> 00:20:30,427
Uh, I guess.

349
00:20:30,529 --> 00:20:32,429
Hey, that wasn't supposed to happen!

350
00:20:32,531 --> 00:20:34,465
Those finks double-crossed me!

351
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:38,024
Poochie's dead!
[Guffawing]

352
00:20:38,136 --> 00:20:39,694
[Cheering]

353
00:20:39,805 --> 00:20:43,036
Well, kids, we all know that sometimes
when cartoon characters die...

354
00:20:43,141 --> 00:20:45,336
they're back again the very next week.

355
00:20:45,444 --> 00:20:48,277
That's why I'm presenting
this sworn affidavit...

356
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:51,281
that Poochie will never,
ever, ever return!

357
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:55,376
This document conforms
to all applicable laws and statutes.

358
00:20:55,487 --> 00:20:57,580
[Children Cheering]

359
00:20:57,689 --> 00:21:00,385
- Oh, yeah!
- [TV Switches Off]

360
00:21:00,492 --> 00:21:04,451
Tough break, Dad. I guess people
just weren't ready for Poochie.

361
00:21:04,563 --> 00:21:07,191
- Maybe in a few years.
- Good news, everybody.

362
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:12,236
I'm movin' into my own apartment
with two sexy ladies.

363
00:21:12,337 --> 00:21:15,363
Oh, then I guess
this is good-bye, Roy.

364
00:21:15,474 --> 00:21:19,205
- Maybe we'll see you in a few years.
- [Clicks Tongue]

365
00:21:19,311 --> 00:21:21,472
Well, I guess I learned my lesson.

366
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:25,346
The thing is, I lost creative control
of the project.

367
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:28,112
And I forgot to ask for any money.

368
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:31,087
Well, live and learn.

369
00:21:31,189 --> 00:21:34,158
## [Instrumental]

370
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:37,626
Oh!

371
00:21:37,729 --> 00:21:39,993
[Screaming]

372
00:21:40,098 --> 00:21:45,001
<i>[Laughs] It's back to the basics-</i>
<i>classic</i> Itchy and Scratchy.

373
00:21:45,103 --> 00:21:47,867
We should thank our lucky stars
they're still putting on...

374
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:50,407
a program of this caliber
after so many years.

375
00:21:53,011 --> 00:21:54,911
What else is on?

376
00:22:40,392 --> 00:22:43,691
- [Murmuring]
- Shh!
