more concerned about us.

Um, do you know how to weld?

173
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:21,451
That worked so well.

We have several hours before the others arrive.
What say we get comfy?

This propane tank will supply us with heat.

337
00:20:59,691 --> 00:21:01,886
Last one in the cabin is fired.

[All Shouting]

339
00:21:06,198 --> 00:21:10,100

something like that with a person...

350
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:45,997
you never want to see that person again.

351
00:21:46,104 --> 00:21:48,902
You said it, ya weirdo!
