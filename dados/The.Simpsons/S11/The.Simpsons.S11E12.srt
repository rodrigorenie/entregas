I mean an award
that's worth winning!

I called the New York Yankees
and told them to bunt...

Aha-ha! Prepare to die!

298
00:19:02,741 --> 00:19:06,802
You too. Aah! Rope burn!

299
00:19:06,912 --> 00:19:09,642
Oh! Oh! Charley horse!
Charley horse!

300
00:19:09,748 --> 00:19:13,206
Aa-aah! Aah! My mouth!
I, eh-

301
00:19:14,253 --> 00:19:17,017
I n the net, right?.

302
00:19:20,092 --> 00:19:23,357
- Some party, Homer.
- Shut up, net-face.

303
00:19:23,462 --> 00:19:27,831
- Hey, you're in the net too.
- I said, "Shut up, net-face"!

304
00:19:27,933 --> 00:19:31,061
Oh, we're gonna die,
and I never tasted cantaloupe!

305
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:35,072
Eh, you didn't miss much.
Honeydew is the money melon.

306
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:37,540
And now we will
cut you loose.

307
00:19:37,643 --> 00:19:42,080
For liability purposes,
it is the ocean that will kill you, not us.

308
00:19:43,715 --> 00:19:45,649
[ All Screaming ]

309
00:19:48,754 --> 00:19:50,847
Hey, what do you know?.
It floats.

310
00:19:50,956 --> 00:19:56,223
That was my plan all along.
Now relax, and the currents will take us home.

311
00:19:56,328 --> 00:19:58,455
What about the people
on the bottom?.

312
00:19:58,564 --> 00:20:00,691
They're the greatest heroes of all.

313
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:04,599
Hey! Something's clawing
at my leg! Okay, it stopped.

314
00:20:07,272 --> 00:20:08,940
It looks great.

315
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:13,310
I can't believe we scrubbed that old-man smell
out of a hundred and thirty-seven rooms.

316
00:20:13,581 --> 00:20:16,881
Smithers old chum, there's nothing like coming home
with a clean bill of health.

317
00:20:17,082 --> 00:20:19,983
- Oh, and sorry about your news.
- Thank you, sir.

318
00:20:20,085 --> 00:20:22,519
Do they know how many eggs
it laid in your brain?.

319
00:20:22,621 --> 00:20:25,351
I prefer not to know.
Frankly, one is too many.

320
00:20:26,792 --> 00:20:29,488
Echh!
The foul stench of youth!

321
00:20:29,595 --> 00:20:31,563
Well, let's see.

322
00:20:31,663 --> 00:20:35,064
Ming vase on narrow column
not knocked down.

323
00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:38,869
Priceless coins not used in vending machine.
Yes, not bad!

324
00:20:39,449 --> 00:20:42,349
Mr.Burns Pirates caught your Yacht

325
00:20:42,949 --> 00:20:47,149
What! I realise though  someone's absence is
unavoidable

326
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:54,551
[ Horrified Gasp ]
Furious George!

327
00:20:54,653 --> 00:20:58,020
What have they done
to your beautiful face?.

328
00:20:58,123 --> 00:21:00,785
Ohh, there, there.

329
00:21:00,892 --> 00:21:05,226
- Smithers, this monkey is going
to need most of your skin.
- [ Groans ]

330
00:21:06,632 --> 00:21:10,090
Ahh, it's good
to be home.

331
00:21:10,202 --> 00:21:14,696
I don't know. After living like a billionaire,
this place is kind of a dump.

332
00:21:14,806 --> 00:21:18,367
Nah, it's not so bad.
Here we can spit on the floor.

333
00:21:18,477 --> 00:21:20,445
Bart, stop that!

334
00:21:20,545 --> 00:21:24,777
Now, we may not have antique furniture
or priceless artwork...

335
00:21:24,883 --> 00:21:27,374
but we have everything we need
right here.

336
00:21:27,486 --> 00:21:32,685
That's right Just because we're not rich
doesn't mean that we don't have-

337
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:36,852
[ Sobbing ]
Oh, I can't even finish!

338
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:39,863
I want to be rich!

339
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:40,065
[ Sobbing Continues ]

340
00:21:40,065 --> 00:21:42,590
[ Sobbing Continues ]

341
00:21:42,701 --> 00:21:46,762
Like these guys!
[ Wailing ]

342
00:21:46,872 --> 00:21:50,364
And. Look at all these
rich people here!

343
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:53,967
Not as rich as they should. be,
of course, but still rich!

344
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:57,173
[ Sobbing ]
All the big money!

345
00:21:57,282 --> 00:22:00,774
Look at all the names
that own money...

and. have lots of money!
[ Sobbing ]

347
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:09,188
Oh, he 's poor. But look at all
the other people that aren 't p-

348
00:22:09,294 --> 00:22:11,592
Oh, look at all the people
who could. buty and. sell me!

349
00:22:11,697 --> 00:22:16,259
I should. send. a list
of these names to the I. R.S.!

350
00:22:16,368 --> 00:22:19,769
I'm taking them all down!
[ Sobbing ]

351
00:22:19,871 --> 00:22:23,272
Oh, look at all the rich people!

352
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:25,605
[ Screaming ]
Oh, look at that rich-
