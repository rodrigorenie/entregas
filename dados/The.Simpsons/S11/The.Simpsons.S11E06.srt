341
00:20:13,278 --> 00:20:16,805
Maggie, you're swimming!
You swam out to save me!

342
00:20:20,018 --> 00:20:23,044
Oh, you do love me!

343
00:20:27,626 --> 00:20:30,094
Mr. Simpson,
you're going to be fine...

344
00:20:30,195 --> 00:20:33,164
although you do seem to have
swallowed a number of shark eggs.

345
00:20:33,265 --> 00:20:36,132
Actually, that was befrore
I went in the ocean.

346
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:39,261
- I don't want to pry into your personal life-
- Then don't!

347
00:20:39,371 --> 00:20:43,068
Doctor, how could a little baby save
a full-grown man from drowning?.

348
00:20:43,175 --> 00:20:45,439
[ Laughing ]
It's quite simple.

349
00:20:45,544 --> 00:20:49,708
When a parent's life is in danger,
a child can summon superhuman strength.

350
00:20:49,815 --> 00:20:53,342
Well, all I care about
is that my little girl loves me.

351
00:20:53,452 --> 00:20:57,889
Oh! And we're gonna spend a lot
more time together from now on.

353
00:21:09,735 --> 00:21:13,432
Good girl, Maggie!
You knocked down all the pins.

354
00:21:13,538 --> 00:21:16,063
But you stepped over the line
just a little bit...

355
00:21:16,174 --> 00:21:18,142
so I'll have to give you a five.

356
00:21:18,243 --> 00:21:22,703
And that gives you
a final score of... 295.

357
00:21:22,814 --> 00:21:27,217
Looks like Daddy won.
But 295 is awfully good for a baby.

358
00:21:28,587 --> 00:21:30,487
Yes, it is. It's very good.

359
00:21:30,589 --> 00:21:34,150
And you're a good little baby.
Yes, you are!
