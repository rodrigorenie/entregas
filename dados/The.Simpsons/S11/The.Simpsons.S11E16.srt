by taking a skydiving lesson?

331
00:19:06,376 --> 00:19:08,810
Well, how can I say no
to such a captivating-

332
00:19:08,911 --> 00:19:11,675
<i>- [ Homer] Ding-dong.
- Whoa! It's the door!</i>

333
00:19:15,184 --> 00:19:17,652
Dr. Winslow.

334
00:19:17,754 --> 00:19:21,121
- Why, who are you?
- I am an angel from the future.

335
00:19:21,224 --> 00:19:23,852
- Angel?
- What the- [ Bleeps ] Should I cut him off?

336
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:26,428
No. Let's see where this is going.

337
00:19:26,529 --> 00:19:29,760
And what do you have to tell us,
O angel of the future?

338
00:19:29,866 --> 00:19:33,996
You're going to die
in a skydiving accident.

339
00:19:34,103 --> 00:19:36,298
How tragic.
Tell me more.

340
00:19:36,406 --> 00:19:39,500
Gabriella's baby shower
will be invaded by terrorists...

341
00:19:39,609 --> 00:19:41,509
with sexy results.

342
00:19:41,611 --> 00:19:44,102
Ooh, that's unexpected.
What else?

343
00:19:44,247 --> 00:19:48,149
Well, Sister Bernadette will leave
the convent and start a softball team...

344
00:19:48,251 --> 00:19:51,948
- with sexy results.
- What's Dad doing on the show?

345
00:19:52,055 --> 00:19:54,216
Who cares?
He's dishing out the dirt.

346
00:19:56,025 --> 00:19:59,051
And only then do we find out
that Professor Galloway's half-sister...

347
00:19:59,162 --> 00:20:02,188
is plotting to take over
International Perfume and Wine.

348
00:20:02,298 --> 00:20:05,597
[ Groans ]
He just gave away a year's worth of story lines.

349
00:20:05,701 --> 00:20:08,670
Cut him off... now.

350
00:20:09,672 --> 00:20:12,106
- [ Both Laughing ]
- Yes!

351
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:14,108
What the hell are you doing?

352
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:16,576
Sticking it to you
for killing off my character.

353
00:20:16,679 --> 00:20:18,476
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

354
00:20:18,581 --> 00:20:22,176
You idiot. Dr. Winslow
was only going to die in a dream.

355
00:20:22,285 --> 00:20:25,152
- Wha-
- Pink pages always mean a dream.

356
00:20:25,254 --> 00:20:27,222
I thought dreams
was on goldenrod.

357
00:20:27,323 --> 00:20:29,518
No, goldenrod
is for coma fantasies.

358
00:20:29,625 --> 00:20:31,525
I see.

359
00:20:31,627 --> 00:20:35,495
So, uh, what time tomorrow?

360
00:20:36,866 --> 00:20:41,530
Escort these men out...
now.

361
00:20:41,637 --> 00:20:45,403
Get your hands off me! Get off!.
I don't need your stinkin' show anyway!

362
00:20:45,508 --> 00:20:49,945
With a mug like this,
I can get on any soap in Springfield.

363
00:20:50,046 --> 00:20:51,946
Hmph!

364
00:20:56,018 --> 00:20:58,748
[ Screams ]

365
00:20:58,855 --> 00:21:02,120
Oh! Oh, my face!
I'm not supposed to put weight on it!

366
00:21:02,225 --> 00:21:04,193
[ All Gasp ]

367
00:21:06,395 --> 00:21:09,159
- [ All Gasp ]
- What? What?

368
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,567
- Sorry about your face, Moe.
- Nah, it's just as well.

369
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:17,696
That handsome face was nice,
but it was too much maintenance.

370
00:21:17,807 --> 00:21:20,435
I had to wash it,
rub it with neat's-foot oil.

371
00:21:20,543 --> 00:21:22,568
You did me a favor, Homer.
And to think...

372
00:21:22,678 --> 00:21:26,239
- I was about to sell the bar to Hooters.
- Yeah, you were- D'oh!

373
00:21:26,349 --> 00:21:29,409
Well, I guess that wraps it up.
There's one thing I don't get though.

374
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:32,886
When my face was crushed,
why did it go back to my old face?

375
00:21:32,989 --> 00:21:37,619
Shouldn't it have turned into some kind of
third face that was different? Don't make no-

376
00:22:24,207 --> 00:22:26,675
<i>- Shh!
- [ Duff Man ] Oh,yeah!</i>
