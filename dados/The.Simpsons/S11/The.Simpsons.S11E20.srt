306
00:17:54,373 --> 00:17:57,900
Little Vicki, I figured out how to dance.
I can be in the show now.

307
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:01,468
I'm sorry, Lisa. People go to
a children's dance recital...

308
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,571
expecting a certain level
of professionalism.

309
00:18:03,682 --> 00:18:05,582
But-Butyou don't understand-

310
00:18:05,684 --> 00:18:10,053
[ Groaning ]
I ate too much plastic candy.

311
00:18:10,155 --> 00:18:12,623
Heavens to betsy.
The star ofthe show is sick.

312
00:18:12,724 --> 00:18:16,251
Whateverwill we do?. There's only one person
who can get us out ofthis pickle.

313
00:18:16,361 --> 00:18:18,261
- Lisa?.
- Yes?.

314
00:18:18,363 --> 00:18:21,230
- Help me into Ralph's costume.
- [ Sighs ]

315
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:24,632
- ## [ Fanfare ]
- Showtime, children. Let's go.

316
00:18:24,736 --> 00:18:28,172
Okay, curtain puller.
This is your moment to shine.

317
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:30,571
Oh, it's too important.
I'll do it foryou.

318
00:18:32,544 --> 00:18:33,772
[ Sighs ]

319
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:39,043
Lean, muscular children of Mars,
we bring you candy.

320
00:18:39,151 --> 00:18:41,847
[ All Giggling ]

321
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:46,220
- Let's walk overto them.
- Whywalkwhen you can dance?.

322
00:18:46,325 --> 00:18:49,260
##[Piano; Pop]

323
00:18:53,098 --> 00:18:57,364
- Where's Lisa?.
- Shh! This plot is hard enough to follow as it is.

324
00:18:57,469 --> 00:19:00,438
# On the spaceship Lollipop #

325
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:03,838
# Gingerbread men
like to do hip-hop #

326
00:19:03,942 --> 00:19:05,341
# And chocolate chips #

327
00:19:05,444 --> 00:19:07,173
- Huh?.
- [ Beeping ]

328
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:09,213
[Tapping]

329
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:14,775
#We just love to dance on Mars
where everything- ##

330
00:19:14,887 --> 00:19:17,515
Oh. There she is. Hi, honey.

331
00:19:17,623 --> 00:19:19,614
Wow. Look at her go.

332
00:19:19,725 --> 00:19:22,717
Yeah, that pressure
we put on her really paid off.

333
00:19:24,263 --> 00:19:26,697
[Audience ]
Ohh! Oh!

334
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:29,767
[ Muttering ]
Whoa!

335
00:19:29,868 --> 00:19:33,133
- What are you doing?.
- I can't help it. It's the shoes.

336
00:19:33,238 --> 00:19:36,002
Nobody upstages Little Vicki.
[ Hisses ]

337
00:19:42,581 --> 00:19:44,947
Oh, please stop.

338
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:47,314
I'm just getting started.

339
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,086
[Audience ]
Ohh!

340
00:19:53,292 --> 00:19:56,193
[ Cheering ]

341
00:19:56,295 --> 00:19:58,024
Stop clapping! Whoa!

342
00:20:02,467 --> 00:20:05,595
Go, Lisa! Come on, everybody.
Give it up for my little girl.

343
00:20:06,572 --> 00:20:08,870
- [ Screaming ]
- [ Muttering ]

344
00:20:10,776 --> 00:20:12,835
Stop the clapping!
You'll kill us all!

345
00:20:12,945 --> 00:20:16,381
[ Screaming ]

346
00:20:16,481 --> 00:20:19,109
[ All Screaming ]

347
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:22,585
Lisa's gone berserk.
Do something, Homer. Do something!

348
00:20:25,691 --> 00:20:29,092
- Oh. Thanks, Dad.
- I didn't think. I...just acted.

349
00:20:29,194 --> 00:20:32,027
- [ Electricity Crackling ]
- Self-tapping shoes?.

350
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:34,030
I'm ever so pissed.

351
00:20:34,132 --> 00:20:37,397
I'm sorry, Vicki. I just wanted
to be a dancer so badly.

352
00:20:37,502 --> 00:20:39,402
[ Sighs ]
I understand.

353
00:20:39,504 --> 00:20:41,904
We all do crazy things
when we're desperate.

354
00:20:42,007 --> 00:20:44,032
I once destroyed Buddy Ebsen's
credit rating.

355
00:20:44,142 --> 00:20:46,940
- Why?.
- He knows why.

356
00:20:47,045 --> 00:20:50,173
Jesus, Mary and glavin!
These shoes are in the off position.

357
00:20:50,282 --> 00:20:52,182
You mean I danced all by myself?.

358
00:20:52,284 --> 00:20:54,684
See, honey?.
All you needed was to believe-

359
00:20:54,786 --> 00:20:56,686
What are you talkin' about,
Professor Frink?.

360
00:20:56,788 --> 00:20:59,518
They're clearly in the on position.
See?. "On."

361
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:03,288
I was merely trying to spare
the girl's feelings, you insensitive clod.

362
00:21:03,395 --> 00:21:07,832
Oh. Ohh! Well, now that
I look even closer-

363
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:09,833
Forget it, Dad.
[ Sighs ]

364
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:12,529
I guess I'm never gonna be
a Broadway baby.

365
00:21:12,638 --> 00:21:16,597
That's not true, honey. You can always write
a depressing Broadway play of some kind.

366
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:18,608
- You think so?.
- Sure.

367
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:22,202
It could be a story about
people coming to terms with things.

368
00:21:22,314 --> 00:21:26,307
Hey, yeah. You could load it up with
lots ofswears. That's what David Mamet does.

369
00:21:26,418 --> 00:21:28,477
Oh, I loveyou guys.

370
00:21:28,587 --> 00:21:32,045
Uh-oh. It's out ofits matrix!
Nobody move!

371
00:21:32,157 --> 00:21:34,182
Why, it's just a cute little weasel.

372
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:36,454
Hello, there, Mr. Weasel.

373
