304
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:51,173
[ Groans ]
I'm getting too old for this crap,

305
00:16:51,276 --> 00:16:55,076
- How old are you anyway?,
-Well, I've been told I can
play anywhere from 28 to-

306
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,579
Sorry I asked,

307
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:00,778
- Aw, crap! Here they come!
- Well, that's it, Homer,

308
00:17:00,886 --> 00:17:03,946
We should've known better than to match wits
with studio executives,

309
00:17:04,056 --> 00:17:07,025
Hey, come on,
Turn that Down Under frown upside down!

310
00:17:07,126 --> 00:17:09,356
We're not finished yet!

311
00:17:12,931 --> 00:17:15,297
Wow! These dummies
look pretty good,

312
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:18,029
Well, I've had a lot
of surgery, old chum,

313
00:17:18,137 --> 00:17:22,836
Shh! Mr., Lamato said he'd fire us
if you didn't stop bothering the customers,

314
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:26,310
Homer, what are you doing here?,

315
00:17:26,412 --> 00:17:31,008
No time talk, Need steal car, Must save
powerful but controversial movie, [ Gasps ]

316
00:17:31,116 --> 00:17:33,016
[ Sputtering ]

317
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:37,420
Hello,
Quick, Mel, get in,

318
00:17:37,523 --> 00:17:40,959
[ Sighs ] Forget it, Homer,
Let's just give them the stupid movie,

319
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,960
Movies aren't stupid!

320
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:46,828
They fill us with romance and hatred
and revenge fantasies,

321
00:17:46,932 --> 00:17:49,366
Lethal Weapon showed us
that suicide is funny,

322
00:17:49,468 --> 00:17:51,231
That really wasn't my intention,

323
00:17:51,336 --> 00:17:55,500
Before Lethal Weapon 2, I never thought
there could be a bomb in my toilet,

324
00:17:55,607 --> 00:17:58,098
But now I check every time,

325
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:00,110
It's true, He does,

326
00:18:00,212 --> 00:18:02,476
Movies mean that much to you,
Homer?,

327
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:06,881
They're my only escape
from the drudgery of work and family,

328
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:11,546
- No offense,
- Ah, what the heck, Let's hit the road,

329
00:18:11,657 --> 00:18:14,455
Shove over, junior,

330
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:22,364
That thoughtless destruction
will surely bankrupt the museum, old chum,

331
00:18:22,468 --> 00:18:24,368
Shut up!

332
00:18:34,913 --> 00:18:38,041
Mom, you gotta take my picture in this car
so I can show Milhouse,

333
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:42,177
Oh, sorry, honey, I used up the last roll
on that man I thought was Judge Judy,

334
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:44,255
- Well, I think we lost them, [ Grunts ]
- [ Crash ]

335
00:18:44,356 --> 00:18:45,983
Oh, wait, There they are,

- But my Dad-

[ All Scream ]

339
00:19:02,241 --> 00:19:04,436
Oh, no!
We killed Mel Gibson!

340
00:19:04,543 --> 00:19:07,239
You all saw it,
He came at me with a knife, right?,

341
00:19:10,115 --> 00:19:12,049
Wait a minute,
He's just a dummy,

342
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:14,119
I know, but he sells tickets,

343
00:19:15,521 --> 00:19:17,148
Let's go,

344
00:19:20,192 --> 00:19:24,822
- Oh, great idea, Mel, Now it's my turn,
- [ Tires Screech ]

345
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:27,194
- What are you doing?,
- I'm tired of running away,

346
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:30,928
Did Braveheart run away?,
Did Payback run away?,

347
00:19:31,036 --> 00:19:34,005
It's time we showed those
suits what we're made of,

348
00:19:35,741 --> 00:19:38,539
The heck is that?,

349
00:19:38,644 --> 00:19:41,909
The one on the left is Mel Gibson,
I don't know who the other two guys are,

350
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:43,982
Will you please tell me
the rest of the plan?,

351
00:19:44,082 --> 00:19:46,482
It's your plan- from Braveheart.

352
00:19:46,585 --> 00:19:48,553
Your army mooned the enemy,,,

353
00:19:48,654 --> 00:19:51,885
until they could take no more
and surrendered,

354
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:55,357
No, they didn't, They attacked us
in a horribly bloody battle, Remember?,

355
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:58,224
- Actually, I didn't see it, But on the poster-

How can you be so calm and cool?,

I think I'm gonna be sick,

for violent dinosaurs like us,

372
00:20:53,352 --> 00:20:55,912
How did the country
lose its way, Mel?,

373
00:20:56,021 --> 00:20:59,115
When did we stop rooting for the man
with the flamethrower,,,

374
00:20:59,224 --> 00:21:01,522
or an acid-spraying gun
of some kind?,

375
00:21:01,627 --> 00:21:04,255
I blame the Internet,
And the return of swing music,

376
00:21:04,363 --> 00:21:07,196
Well, whatever it is, we gotta get rolling
on our next picture,

Hey, what about a prequel to something?,
Everybody loves prequels,

You could be the ghost
or the lottery commissioner,

Ooh!
What about Indiana Jones?

Does anyone own the rights to that?
