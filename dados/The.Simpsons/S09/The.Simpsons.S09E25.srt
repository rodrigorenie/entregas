00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:40,205
- [Crowd Gasps]
- <i>[Man] That's hideous!</i>

327
00:20:40,305 --> 00:20:44,105
Why don't you take a picture?
It lasts longer!

328
00:20:44,209 --> 00:20:46,200
- [Camera Shutters Clicking]
- D'oh!

329
00:20:46,311 --> 00:20:49,109
It would have
to be camera day.

330
00:20:49,214 --> 00:20:52,513
[Cheering, Whistling]

331
00:20:55,654 --> 00:20:57,588
- Wow!
- Hey!

332
00:20:57,689 --> 00:21:00,487
I don't want you reading
those awful scandal sheets.

333
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:03,652
Uh, I was just trying to find
Dave Barry's column.

334
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:06,230
He's great. He pokes fun
at life's little foibles.

335
00:21:07,399 --> 00:21:10,334
Kids, I want to explain
about the stadium.

336
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:13,268
You see, sometimes
moms and dads...

337
00:21:13,372 --> 00:21:16,535
get a little, well,
accustomed to each other.

338
00:21:16,642 --> 00:21:20,408
- Dads especially.
- So they need to explore new ways...

339
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:22,707
to express their love.

340
00:21:22,814 --> 00:21:27,444
Scary ways. But we never
intended it to end like that...

341
00:21:27,552 --> 00:21:31,784
with thousands of people
staring at our naked bodies.

342
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:35,382
All those eyes... just leering
and leering at us.

343
00:21:37,396 --> 00:21:41,560
- Who's in the mood for miniature golf?
- Ooh, I am!

344
00:21:41,667 --> 00:21:45,535
[Both Cheering]

345
00:21:49,741 --> 00:21:55,111
Huh. They're gonna feel so silly
when they realize they forgot us.

346
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,943
<i>##[Man Singing Runk Rock]</i>

347
00:22:40,592 --> 00:22:42,753
- [Chattering]
- Shh!
