- before we open fire!
- Uh, it's my first day!

328
00:20:35,968 --> 00:20:40,530
- [All Laughing]
- [Speaking Spanish]

329
00:20:40,639 --> 00:20:44,973
- [Laughing]
- [Speaking Chinese]

330
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:47,511
- [Laughing]
- Quack, quack, quack.

331
00:20:47,613 --> 00:20:49,843
[Chittering]

332
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:56,952
Seaman Simpson, your actions
have given the Navy...

333
00:20:57,055 --> 00:20:59,023
a black eye from which
it may never recover.

334
00:20:59,124 --> 00:21:03,254
I would throw the book at you, but
I've been indicted in the Tailhook scandal.

335
00:21:03,362 --> 00:21:06,456
- Good-bye.
- I, too, would punish you...

336
00:21:06,565 --> 00:21:10,296
but I'm under indictment for accepting
bribes from military contractors.

337
00:21:11,703 --> 00:21:14,536
Um, I torpedoed
a Carnival Cruise ship.

338
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,200
Impersonating the first lady.

339
00:21:19,177 --> 00:21:22,374
- I think you're off the hook.
- Whoo-hoo!

340
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:30,114
A dishonorable discharge.
That's the best we could have hoped for.

341
00:21:30,222 --> 00:21:33,714
You can't spell "dishonorable"
without "honorable."

342
00:21:33,825 --> 00:21:35,850
I think you're a hero, Dad.

343
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:38,191
Well, I couldn't have
done it without Bart.

344
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:42,131
Boy, I guess I was wrong about
that earring. It saved us all.

345
00:21:42,234 --> 00:21:44,725
Then can I get a tattoo that says,
"Bite me"?

346
00:21:44,836 --> 00:21:46,827
You never know when
it might come in handy.

347
00:21:46,938 --> 00:21:48,838
- I don't think so, Son.
- A king cobra?

348
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:50,339
- No.
- <i>Weapons-grade plutonium?</i>

349
00:21:50,442 --> 00:21:52,034
- Ask your mother.
- Knockout drops?

350
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:53,577
- No.
- Ninja death stars?

351
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:54,646
Maybe for Christmas.

352
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:42,160
- [Murmuring]
- Shh!
