[Whooping Continues]

341
00:19:32,804 --> 00:19:35,466
[All Panting]

342
00:19:38,143 --> 00:19:41,169
[Groans]
I can't go on.

343
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,716
You two go ahead.
And carry me with you.

344
00:19:44,816 --> 00:19:46,943
- [Groans]
- Oh, come on, man.

345
00:19:47,052 --> 00:19:48,883
Hurry! They're catching up!

346
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,682
Here, Milhouse.
You go first.

347
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:58,857
Okay. Now throw the vine back.

348
00:19:58,964 --> 00:20:01,057
- There's no time.
- [Gasps]

349
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:03,134
[Whooping]

350
00:20:05,837 --> 00:20:07,805
[Grunts]

351
00:20:12,144 --> 00:20:14,476
Look. We can hide in that cave.

352
00:20:16,815 --> 00:20:18,715
[All Panting]

353
00:20:18,817 --> 00:20:20,717
[Lisa]
We should be safe in here.

354
00:20:20,819 --> 00:20:23,344
<i>[Nelson]</i>
<i>They're trapped in the cave. Move in for the kill.</i>

355
00:20:23,455 --> 00:20:25,013
Oh, figs.

356
00:20:25,123 --> 00:20:28,354
[Whooping]

357
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:33,557
Stop! You are in violation
of the Model U.N. charter!

358
00:20:33,665 --> 00:20:37,897
Uh, that's right.
The U.N. doesn't look too kindly on-

359
00:20:38,003 --> 00:20:40,631
- The monster!
- [Growls]

360
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:43,299
[All Screaming]

361
00:20:48,447 --> 00:20:52,315
Your monster appears to be
nothing but a run-of-the-mill wild boar.

362
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:54,385
Hey. Look at his tusk.

363
00:20:54,486 --> 00:20:57,319
<i>So the boar ate our food.</i>

364
00:20:57,422 --> 00:21:01,085
Oh. Sorry about that whole
trying to kill you thing.

365
00:21:01,193 --> 00:21:03,127
Yeah.
Well, you should be!

366
00:21:03,228 --> 00:21:06,629
I only stole two sandwiches
and a bag of Doritos.

367
00:21:06,732 --> 00:21:11,431
Hey. If a boar can survive here,
there must be a source of food.

368
00:21:11,536 --> 00:21:14,937
Look. He's licking
the slime off that rock.

369
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:17,838
That's what he's been eating.
Slime!

370
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:21,401
And there's enough slime for all of us.
We're saved!

371
00:21:29,488 --> 00:21:33,447
All that slime
made this boar extra tender.

372
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:36,459
More snout anyone?

373
00:21:36,561 --> 00:21:39,428
Mmm! Mmm!
How's your dinner, Lise?

374
00:21:39,531 --> 00:21:43,092
Ah, shut up.
Savages.

375
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:48,501
<i>[Man Narrating]</i>
<i>So the children learned to function as a society.</i>

376
00:21:48,607 --> 00:21:52,065
<i>And eventually,</i>
<i>they were rescued by...</i>

377
00:21:52,177 --> 00:21:54,839
<i>oh, let's say Moe.</i>

378
00:22:40,325 --> 00:22:42,293
- [Murmuring]
- Shh!
