338
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:32,360
Are you sure you ladies wouldn't prefer
some gingerbread children instead?

339
00:20:32,464 --> 00:20:34,523
- They're boneless.
- [All] Hmm?

340
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:41,568
- [All] Mmm.
- <i>[Children] Ow!</i>

341
00:20:41,673 --> 00:20:44,198
[Hooting]

342
00:20:45,777 --> 00:20:48,507
Bye, witches.
Thanks for not eating me.

343
00:20:48,614 --> 00:20:50,514
Yeah, you hags are all right.

344
00:20:50,616 --> 00:20:52,811
What did you get?

345
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:56,183
- A candied apple.
- I got a caramel cod.

346
00:20:57,556 --> 00:21:02,357
You know, scaring people
into giving us treats is fun.

347
00:21:02,461 --> 00:21:04,361
We should do this every year.

348
00:21:04,463 --> 00:21:08,559
I just wish we hadrt filled up on all
those kids before we got to the Flanders'.

349
00:21:08,667 --> 00:21:10,567
[Belches]

350

[All Cackling]

351
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:18,603
Yargh. And that's the story
of the very first caramel cod.

352
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:21,702
I mean, Halloween.
And it wasrt long...

353
00:21:21,813 --> 00:21:25,874
before this yearly custom
became an annual tradition.

354
00:21:29,688 --> 00:21:32,657
[Children Chattering]

355
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:42,559
Come on! Give us some candy!
Don't pretend you're not home.

356
00:21:42,668 --> 00:21:44,465
Dad, that's our house.

357
00:21:44,569 --> 00:21:47,834
[Crowd Laughing]

358
00:21:47,939 --> 00:21:50,305
- She's a witch!
- <i>[Man] Get her!</i>

359
00:21:50,409 --> 00:21:53,503
- [Crowd Shouting]
- [Lisa Screaming]
