00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:22,619
All right, everybody, hands up!

333
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:24,951
You, give me the cash drawer.

334
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:27,582
Do what he says.
I'm too rich to die.

335
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:32,287
Freeze, bad guy!

336
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:36,197
- Vote Quimby!
- Okay, man. Don't shoot. Chill.

337
00:20:36,301 --> 00:20:41,500
Homer, you said you got rid of the gun!
You lied to me again!

338
00:20:41,607 --> 00:20:44,804
- I know I said that,
but what I secretly meant was-
- Yoink!

339
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,935
[Sinister Laughter]

340
00:20:47,045 --> 00:20:50,071
The joke's on you, buddy.
There's no bullets in that thing.

341
00:20:50,182 --> 00:20:52,446
- [Rattling]
- [Laughing]

342
00:20:52,551 --> 00:20:54,451
Yo, give me the bullets.

343
00:20:54,553 --> 00:20:57,716
- Okay. Don't shoot!
- [All] Drop it!

344
00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:02,490
Bye!

345
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:04,755
How did you know
we were being robbed?

346
00:21:04,863 --> 00:21:08,355
The clerk here pressed the silent alarm,
and we picked it up on our scanner.

347
00:21:08,467 --> 00:21:12,301
- Did anyone stop that robber?
- No, I don't think so.

348
00:21:14,906 --> 00:21:16,931
I'm sorry I lied to you, Marge...

349
00:21:17,042 --> 00:21:19,272
but this gun had a hold on me.

350
00:21:19,378 --> 00:21:21,903
I felt this incredible
surge of power...

351
00:21:22,014 --> 00:21:24,710
like God must feel
when he's holding a gun.

352
00:21:24,816 --> 00:21:29,981
So please, get rid of it, because I know
I'll just lie to you again and again.

353
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:42,433
Hmm!

354
00:22:39,491 --> 00:22:41,789
- [Murmuring]
- Shh!
