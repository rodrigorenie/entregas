328
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:49,414
Really? 'Cause I'm a travel agent and
I've heard nothing but bad things.

329
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:52,950
- [ All Grunting ]
- Let go!

330
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:57,194
- [ Ringing ]
- Y'ello?

331
00:19:57,296 --> 00:20:00,493
- Hello. This is President Clinton.
- Hey, how you doing?

332
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:05,229
Your determination and grit under
extreme pressure are an inspiration.

333
00:20:05,337 --> 00:20:09,103
- The whole country is proud of you.
- Well, it's about time!

334
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,472
And on behalf of America,
I'd like to-

335
00:20:11,577 --> 00:20:13,477
Ow!

336
00:20:13,579 --> 00:20:15,638
All right, Lovejoy!
You're gonna get it.

337
00:20:15,747 --> 00:20:20,411
Hello? Hello? I command you
to answer me! Hello?

338
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:23,750
Al, do you have to
do that right now?

339
00:20:25,857 --> 00:20:28,417
What are you gonna do
with your Super Bowl ring, Carl?

340
00:20:28,527 --> 00:20:31,121
I'll probably give it to my wife.
It's our anniversary today.

341
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,629
[ All Sighing ]

342
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:34,631
Dad, that doesn't belong to you.

343
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:36,792
But this might be
my last chance to win one.

344
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:41,100
We sure put together a heck of a trip, Homer.
Ever thought about being a travel agent?

345
00:20:41,206 --> 00:20:43,572
Wally, I'd be lying if I said I hadn't.

346
00:20:43,675 --> 00:20:46,838
'Cause you can really ''go places''
in the travel business.

347
00:20:46,945 --> 00:20:50,779
- Huh? Feel free to use that one.
- What one?

348
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,285
Well,John, what did you think
of tonight's episode?

349
00:20:56,388 --> 00:20:59,687
I loved it. The last-minute addition
of Wally Kogen to the lineup...

350
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:02,225
was a bit of a gamble,
but it really paid off.

351
00:21:02,327 --> 00:21:05,785
Marge and Lisa painting eggs-
did that work for you?

352
00:21:05,897 --> 00:21:09,663
Oh, big-time! They came
off the bench with a huge effort...

353
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:12,965
that allowed Homer and Bart
to make some significant gains.

354
00:21:13,071 --> 00:21:16,472
Did it strike you as odd that in
a Super Bowl show with Dolly Parton...

355
00:21:16,575 --> 00:21:18,941
we didn't see any football or singing?

356
00:21:19,044 --> 00:21:22,673
I hadn't thought about it, Pat.
But in retrospect, it was kind of a rip-off.

357
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:24,840
What a way to treat
the loyal fans...

358
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:28,010
who've put up with so much nonsense
from this franchise.

359
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:31,817
- Any final thoughts?
- Nah, I'm too mad. Let's get the heck out of here.

360
00:21:33,158 --> 00:21:36,924
All aboard, boys.
I've been waiting for you.

361
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:39,395
Now, I'll tell you-
that doesn't make a lick of sense!

362
00:21:39,498 --> 00:21:41,728
I know.
Just get on the bus.

363
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:45,030
- <i>[ Gears Grinding ]</i>
- <i>[ Price ] Where's that infernal clutch?</i>

364
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:48,971
- <i>Wait, wait. I'll get it.</i>
- <i>[ Boy ] Give it some gas, Grandpa.</i>

365
00:21:49,074 --> 00:21:51,941
<i>Oh, quiet,Jody.</i>
<i>You're not helping.</i>

366
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:56,106
<i>##[ Rock ]</i>

367
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:01,751
<i>##[ Instrumental Easy Listening ]</i>

368
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:40,757
<i>[ Rupert Murdoch ]</i>
<i>Silence.!</i>
