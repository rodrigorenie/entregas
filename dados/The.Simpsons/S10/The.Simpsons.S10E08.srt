Even the sea won't forgive me.

00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:24,196
That's the best sand castle
we've ever built, Dad!

313
00:18:24,303 --> 00:18:26,294
We make a great team, Son.

314
00:18:26,405 --> 00:18:31,707
Oh, I wish I had that kind
of relationship with my father.

315
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:35,075
[ Sniffs ]
Or my kids.

All right. This is it.
No more living in shame.

320
00:18:47,726 --> 00:18:51,594
I'm going to show my family

Aren't you going to give him
the last rites?

326
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:14,476
That's Catholic, Marge. You might as well
ask me to do a voodoo dance.

327
00:19:14,586 --> 00:19:17,749
Dr. Hibbert, I thought you'd located
another kidney for Grampa.

328
00:19:17,856 --> 00:19:21,986
Larry Hagman took it.
He's got five of them now. And three hearts.

329
00:19:22,094 --> 00:19:25,154
We didn't want to give them to him,
but he overpowered us.

330
00:19:25,264 --> 00:19:30,031
Don't worry about old Grampa.
I'm going to a better place.

- Son!
- I'm sorry, Dad.

336
00:19:43,315 --> 00:19:47,115
The way I behaved was shameful.
I guess fear made me run away.

337
00:19:47,219 --> 00:19:50,120
But love made me come back.

338

Bless you, Son.

Try not to move, Dad.
You swallowed a lot of motor oil.

I'm sorry I ran off again.

When I get better...

we helped ourselves to a kidney
and gave it to your father.

I'll get my kidney back, old man!

You have to sleep sometime.

I know you're a little peeved at Grampa,
Dad, but you've done a wonderful thing.

Yes. You've shortened
your life significantly...
