a showdown, boy.

- All right.
- What are you doing?

304
00:18:52,931 --> 00:18:56,628

I'm afraid I can't let you do this, Red.
The risk is unacceptable.

Now that man is a genuine, steel-belted,

- You can say that again.
- Yeah.

322
00:19:45,884 --> 00:19:49,479
Boys, I've been thinking. Maybe it's time
we ditched the high-tech gizmos...

323
00:19:49,588 --> 00:19:51,647
and went back to driving

Yeah, sure it's hard work
and it's lonely as hell.

But it has meaning and dignity.
Huh? What do you say?

Nah. Let's just find some other scam.

Hey, how about bootlegging
Beanie Babies?

- Oh, I like that.

Yep, you're gonna make it, Dad.

So where is old Red anyway?

Well, the last time I saw him,
he was in a big plastic bag.

Ha. Yeah, that sounds
like Red, all right.

Well, Son, I guess
it's time to go home.
