1
00:00:06,145 --> 00:00:07,603
Homer the Great

2
00:00:39,887 --> 00:00:42,556
- Looks like you got a leak.
- Could you start fixing it?

3
00:00:42,723 --> 00:00:47,468
The basement is getting awfully flooded.
And I think the cat's down there.

4
00:00:48,145 --> 00:00:52,357
Yeah, I probably won't be able to get
the parts I need for two, three weeks.

5
00:00:52,566 --> 00:00:54,559
And that's if I order them today.

6
00:00:54,777 --> 00:00:58,270
- Which I won't.
- Oh, dear.

7
00:01:00,324 --> 00:01:02,320
Emergency call. Gotta go.

8
00:01:02,242 --> 00:01:06,406
- What should we do until you get back?
- Put a pan down there.

9
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:12,413
It didn't work.

10
00:01:15,798 --> 00:01:18,205
Lousy traffic jams.

11
00:01:18,425 --> 00:01:21,343
The traffic report will
get me out of this one.

12
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,428
This is Ernie Pie.

13
00:01:23,639 --> 00:01:28,680
We got a little accident that's backing
traffic up as far as this reporter can see.

14
00:01:37,945 --> 00:01:39,688
Hi, Dad.

15
00:01:46,537 --> 00:01:50,237
Hey, how come you guys
got such great parking places?

16
00:01:50,457 --> 00:01:53,244
- It's a secret.
- Shut up.

17
00:02:01,969 --> 00:02:05,219
All right, Econo-Save,
you just made the list.

18
00:02:10,102 --> 00:02:12,344
Hey, will you guys help me fix my...?

19
00:02:14,106 --> 00:02:18,200
Hey, how come you guys
got better chairs than me?

20
00:02:18,235 --> 00:02:20,904
- It's a secret.
- Shut up.

21
00:02:26,952 --> 00:02:28,779
Hey, you guys
wanna go bowling tonight?

22
00:02:28,996 --> 00:02:31,617
- No, we're busy.
- Yeah, we got things to do.

23
00:02:31,832 --> 00:02:33,575
Like what?

24
00:02:33,792 --> 00:02:35,915
It's a secret.

25
00:02:36,253 --> 00:02:38,246
Shut up.

26
00:02:40,174 --> 00:02:42,546
So Lenny and Carl are never
around on Wednesdays.

27
00:02:42,718 --> 00:02:45,470
They don't tell me where they go.
It's like a conspiracy.

28
00:02:45,638 --> 00:02:49,718
A conspiracy, eh? You think they're
involved in the Kennedy assassination?

29
00:02:49,933 --> 00:02:52,341
I do now.

30
00:02:52,561 --> 00:02:55,182
I'm gonna follow them tonight
and see where they go.

31
00:02:55,397 --> 00:02:59,644
Oh, Homer, don't start stalking
people again. It's so illegal.

32
00:02:59,818 --> 00:03:03,152
You stalked Charles Kuralt because
you thought he dug up your garden.

33
00:03:03,364 --> 00:03:06,863
- Well, something did.
- I don't want you stalking anyone.

34
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:09,525
Oh, okay.
Have it your own way, Marge.

35
00:03:09,745 --> 00:03:11,453
I'll be back in a minute.

36
00:03:11,664 --> 00:03:14,748
I'm going outside...

37
00:03:14,958 --> 00:03:17,496
...to stalk...

38
00:03:17,711 --> 00:03:20,629
...Lenny and Carl...

39
00:03:37,564 --> 00:03:40,768
All I have to do
is follow the yellow-drip road.

40
00:03:47,366 --> 00:03:50,283
- There's our secret meeting place.
- Yes. Let's go inside.

41
00:03:50,452 --> 00:03:52,362
Sounds good.

42
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:10,295
I can see everything
and they're none the wiser.

43
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,937
- An intruder!
- He will pay the ultimate price.

44
00:04:23,152 --> 00:04:25,690
Yes, the ultimate price.

45
00:04:25,904 --> 00:04:28,656
Get out of here!

46
00:04:31,368 --> 00:04:33,824
I saw weird stuff
in that place last night.

47
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:39,320
Weird, strange, sick, twisted, eerie,
godless, evil stuff. And I want in.

48
00:04:39,251 --> 00:04:41,458
We don't know what
you're talking about, Homer.

49
00:04:41,628 --> 00:04:44,202
You can't join the Stonecutters.
It's too exclusive.

50
00:04:44,381 --> 00:04:45,875
Oh, well.

51
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:48,761
That was a real nice
secret organization we had once.

52
00:04:48,969 --> 00:04:50,677
Stonecutters, eh? How do I join?

53
00:04:50,888 --> 00:04:52,715
There are two ways
to gain membership:

54
00:04:52,931 --> 00:04:55,800
- Be the son of a Stonecutter.
- Next.

55
00:04:55,225 --> 00:04:57,990
Or save the life of a Stonecutter.

56
00:04:57,311 --> 00:04:58,722
Hey!

57
00:04:59,396 --> 00:05:03,524
I saved your life. That egg sandwich
could've killed you by cholesterol.

58
00:05:03,734 --> 00:05:07,317
Forget it, Homer. While it has been
established eggs contain cholesterol...

59
00:05:07,488 --> 00:05:10,275
...it has not been proven
that they raise the level...

60
00:05:10,491 --> 00:05:12,898
...of serum cholesterol
in the human bloodstream.

61
00:05:13,118 --> 00:05:15,158
Those Egg Council creeps
got to you too?

62
00:05:15,371 --> 00:05:19,238
Oh, you got it all wrong, Homer.
It's not like that.

63
00:05:20,668 --> 00:05:22,459
You'd better run, egg!

64
00:05:22,753 --> 00:05:24,746
Why don't people like me, Marge?

65
00:05:24,964 --> 00:05:27,799
Everyone likes you.
You're a wonderful person.

66
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,930
Why don't those stupid idiots
let me in their crappy club for jerks?

67
00:05:31,303 --> 00:05:33,794
- I'm sure it's nothing personal, Homer.
- It is.

68
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:36,636
It's been happening to me all my life.

69
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:42,768
Hey, Billy, hey, Joey, come on in.
There's plenty of room.

70
00:05:42,982 --> 00:05:45,817
- Sorry. Not you, Homer.
- Why not?

71
00:05:48,487 --> 00:05:50,563
But you let in Homer Glumpet.

72
00:05:50,781 --> 00:05:53,782
It says "no Homers."

73
00:05:53,993 --> 00:05:55,451
We're allowed to have one.

74
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:59,570
I felt so left out.

75
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:04,333
- Kids can be so cruel.
- We can? Thanks, Mom.

76
00:06:04,628 --> 00:06:07,000
Cut it out, Bart!

77
00:06:07,631 --> 00:06:09,956
I'd give anything
to get into the Stonecutters.

78
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:12,382
- What do they do there, Dad?
- I'm a member.

79
00:06:12,594 --> 00:06:15,264
What do they do?
What don't they do?

80
00:06:15,472 --> 00:06:17,880
Oh, they do so many things,
they never stop.

81
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:22,180
- Oh, the things they do there. My stars.
- You don't know what they do, do you?

82
00:06:22,396 --> 00:06:24,389
- Not as such, no.
- I'm a Stonecutter.

83
00:06:24,606 --> 00:06:28,272
Remember those self-hypnosis classes
we took to help us ignore Grampa?

84
00:06:28,485 --> 00:06:31,605
Do I ever. It's five years later
and I still think I'm a chicken.

85
00:06:31,822 --> 00:06:34,280
- I'm a chicken, Marge.
- I know, I know.

86
00:06:34,241 --> 00:06:36,115
Maybe we should be
listening to him now.

87
00:06:36,327 --> 00:06:38,153
I'm a member!

88
00:06:38,329 --> 00:06:40,360
- What?
- What?

89
00:06:40,205 --> 00:06:42,281
You're a member of
the Stonecutters, Grampa?

90
00:06:42,499 --> 00:06:44,741
Oh, sure. Let's see.

91
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,800
I'm an Elk, a Mason, a Communist.

92
00:06:48,297 --> 00:06:52,247
I'm the president of the Gay & Lesbian
Alliance, for some reason.

93
00:06:52,468 --> 00:06:55,587
Here it is. The Stonecutters.

94
00:06:55,804 --> 00:06:57,429
This is it. My ticket in.

95
00:06:57,639 --> 00:07:00,131
They have to let me join
if I'm the son of a member.

96
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:02,758
I'll take this Communist one too.

97
00:07:03,562 --> 00:07:06,598
Coming through. Can't throw me out.
My father's a member.

98
00:07:06,815 --> 00:07:09,271
- I'm in, I'm in.
- Okay, okay, Homer, you're in.

99
00:07:09,485 --> 00:07:11,145
Just don't point that thing at me.

100
00:07:11,362 --> 00:07:14,446
Thanks, Lenny.
When am I gonna be initiated?

101
00:07:14,657 --> 00:07:18,108
- As soon as Number One gets here.
- Number One?

102
00:07:18,327 --> 00:07:21,790
What kind of stupid
wiener name is that?

103
00:07:21,288 --> 00:07:25,831
"Hello, my name is Number One."

104
00:07:26,293 --> 00:07:27,835
And so forth.

105
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:29,504
We call each other by number.

106
00:07:29,672 --> 00:07:32,838
Carl is Number 14, I'm Number 12.
Burnsie is Number 29.

107
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,458
- You outrank Mr. Burns here?
- Sure. Watch.

108
00:07:35,678 --> 00:07:38,465
Hey, 29, get over here!

109
00:07:41,725 --> 00:07:43,718
Thank you, sir. May I have another?

110
00:07:46,647 --> 00:07:49,683
Patience, Monty. Climb the ladder.

111
00:07:51,694 --> 00:07:53,935
- Is he the leader?
- Of this chapter.

112
00:07:54,113 --> 00:07:57,279
There are chapters all over the world.
And it has been foretold...

113
00:07:57,449 --> 00:07:59,359
...that someday a Chosen One will...

114
00:07:59,576 --> 00:08:02,320
Okay, okay. I didn't ask
for your life story.

115
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:07,782
Let the initiation begin.

116
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:11,121
All Stonecutters must take
the Leap of Faith.

117
00:08:11,338 --> 00:08:16,296
If you survive this five-story plunge,
your character will be proven.

118
00:08:17,636 --> 00:08:18,965
Happy landings!

119
00:08:31,442 --> 00:08:35,486
I think I have to do it again.
My blindfold came off.

120
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:39,696
This ritual is called
Crossing the Desert.

121
00:08:41,827 --> 00:08:45,694
And this we call the Unblinking Eye.

122
00:08:48,167 --> 00:08:50,918
Hey, have you ever noticed
that the Crossing the Desert...

123
00:08:51,128 --> 00:08:52,836
...is a lot like the Unblinking Eye?

124
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,247
And exactly like
the Wreck of the Hesperus.

125
00:08:55,466 --> 00:08:57,209
And now the final ordeal:

126
00:08:57,384 --> 00:09:01,299
The Paddling of the Swollen Ass,
with paddles.

127
00:09:04,933 --> 00:09:09,140
And by the sacred parchment,
I swear that if I reveal the secrets...

128
00:09:09,229 --> 00:09:11,899
...of the Stonecutters,
may my stomach become bloated...

129
00:09:12,107 --> 00:09:15,607
...and my head be plucked
of all but three hairs.

130
00:09:15,819 --> 00:09:17,646
He should have to take
a different oath.

131
00:09:17,863 --> 00:09:19,654
Everyone takes the same oath.

132
00:09:19,865 --> 00:09:22,403
Welcome to the club, Number 908.

133
00:09:22,618 --> 00:09:25,323
You have joined the Sacred Order
of the Stonecutters...

134
00:09:25,537 --> 00:09:28,574
...who since ancient times
have split the rocks of ignorance...

135
00:09:28,749 --> 00:09:31,418
...that obscure the light
of knowledge and truth.

136
00:09:31,627 --> 00:09:34,340
Now let's all get drunk
and play Ping-Pong.

137
00:09:35,506 --> 00:09:37,629
He's already kind of heavy,
you know, and...

138
00:09:40,928 --> 00:09:44,676
Well, to be honest, I never got around
to ordering that part for you.

139
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:47,346
So it's still gonna be
a couple of weeks.

140
00:09:47,559 --> 00:09:50,477
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

141
00:09:50,688 --> 00:09:53,392
- Really?
- Yes. Yes.

142
00:09:53,607 --> 00:09:57,475
But what if I were to shake your hand
in this way?

143
00:10:01,573 --> 00:10:03,732
Well, I didn't realize
you were a member.

144
00:10:11,959 --> 00:10:13,536
So long, suckers.

145
00:10:25,973 --> 00:10:28,490
- Same old space, huh, Dad?
- Yep.

146
00:10:28,225 --> 00:10:33,765
But they gave me these Rollerblades
so I can glide to the front door.

147
00:10:37,443 --> 00:10:38,771
Sweet.

148
00:10:41,697 --> 00:10:45,148
- Jealous?
- Well, no. We've got the same chair.

149
00:10:45,367 --> 00:10:46,826
You're jealous.

150
00:10:47,411 --> 00:10:50,246
- Your membership pack.
- What's this?

151
00:10:50,456 --> 00:10:52,994
You put that on your car
so you won't get any tickets.

152
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:55,616
This keeps paramedics
from stealing your wallet.

153
00:10:55,836 --> 00:10:59,537
Oh, and don't bother calling 911
anymore. Here's the real number.

154
00:11:03,635 --> 00:11:07,870
I still don't believe all the
Founding Fathers were Stonecutters.

155
00:11:07,306 --> 00:11:10,930
That's because you trust
your stupid schoolbooks.

156
00:11:10,309 --> 00:11:12,467
Here's what really happened
at the signing...

157
00:11:12,645 --> 00:11:14,970
...of the Declaration of Independence.

158
00:11:17,191 --> 00:11:19,896
And a nation is born.

159
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:24,190
Now let us party like 'twere 1799!

160
00:11:25,908 --> 00:11:30,360
Quaff! Quaff! Quaff!

161
00:11:33,165 --> 00:11:36,000
Please, sir. You're destroying
my establishment.

162
00:11:36,168 --> 00:11:41,755
We just created the greatest democracy
on earth, lowlife commoner! Get out!

163
00:11:41,924 --> 00:11:45,507
Wanna see how Davy Crockett really
died at the Alamo? You must be 18.

164
00:11:46,178 --> 00:11:49,132
Homer, a man who called himself
"you know who"...

165
00:11:49,306 --> 00:11:52,841
...just invited you to a secret
"wink-wink" at the "you know what."

166
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:55,343
Sure are popular
now that you're a Stonecutter.

167
00:11:55,521 --> 00:12:00,681
Oh, yeah. Beer busts, beer blasts,
keggers, stein hoist...

168
00:12:00,859 --> 00:12:02,733
...AA meetings, beer night.

169
00:12:02,903 --> 00:12:07,861
It's wonderful, Marge. I've never
felt so accepted in all my life.

170
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:10,358
These people look
deep within my soul...

171
00:12:10,536 --> 00:12:15,328
...and assign me a number
based on the order in which I joined.

172
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,834
Who controls the British crown?
Who keeps the metric system down?

173
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,880
We do
We do

174
00:12:28,304 --> 00:12:32,432
Who leaves Atlantis off the maps?
Who keeps the Martians under wraps?

175
00:12:32,599 --> 00:12:36,265
We do
We do

176
00:12:36,687 --> 00:12:40,685
Who holds back the electric car?

177
00:12:40,858 --> 00:12:45,690
Who makes Steve Guttenberg a star?

178
00:12:45,237 --> 00:12:49,317
We do
We do

179
00:12:49,491 --> 00:12:53,489
Who robs cavefish of their sight?
Who rigs every Oscar night?

180
00:12:53,662 --> 00:12:56,747
We do

181
00:12:56,915 --> 00:13:00,699
We do

182
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:03,746
Thank you. Tonight we are here...

183
00:13:03,922 --> 00:13:07,706
...to commemorate our glorious
society's 1500th anniversary.

184
00:13:07,926 --> 00:13:10,762
And in honor of this
momentous occasion...

185
00:13:10,929 --> 00:13:14,429
...we're having ribs.
- Yeah!

186
00:13:16,643 --> 00:13:21,222
I need a bib. If I slop any on my shirt,
I could lose the respect of my brethren.

187
00:13:21,398 --> 00:13:23,307
So let us rejoice and enjoy our meal...

188
00:13:23,484 --> 00:13:28,726
...in the shadow of the hallowed
sacred parchment.

189
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:35,238
- Homer.
- Oh, yeah. Thanks, Lenny.

190
00:13:35,663 --> 00:13:37,988
This is just appalling and outrageous.

191
00:13:38,165 --> 00:13:40,371
What? Did I miss something?

192
00:13:42,586 --> 00:13:43,914
Oh, God!

193
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,839
No, Homer, no! This is outrageous!
You can't do that!

194
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:50,300
- No!
- You really are stupid.

195
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:57,426
And the official Stonecutter
underwear too.

196
00:14:04,274 --> 00:14:07,145
Please don't kick me out.
This society's everything to me.

197
00:14:07,319 --> 00:14:10,190
Please give me another chance.
I've learned my lesson!

198
00:14:10,364 --> 00:14:12,771
I've learned my lesson!

199
00:14:13,826 --> 00:14:15,534
That's it!

200
00:14:15,703 --> 00:14:17,861
- How can we punish him further?
- Oh, sorry.

201
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:22,700
Homer Simpson, for your continuing
and baffling desecration...

202
00:14:22,876 --> 00:14:25,202
...of our beloved sacred parchment...

203
00:14:25,379 --> 00:14:29,127
...you are hereby banished
from the Stonecutters forever.

204
00:14:29,299 --> 00:14:33,796
And as a final humiliation,
you must walk home naked...

205
00:14:33,971 --> 00:14:37,921
...dragging behind you
the Stone of Shame.

206
00:14:46,859 --> 00:14:48,187
The mark!

207
00:14:49,695 --> 00:14:53,278
Oh, that. It's just a birthmark.
And I'll thank you not to stare.

208
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:56,160
He's the Chosen One.

209
00:14:57,911 --> 00:15:00,284
You are the Chosen One...

210
00:15:00,456 --> 00:15:05,340
...whom the sacred parchment
prophesied would lead us to glory.

211
00:15:05,294 --> 00:15:09,374
Now to the top of Mount Springfield
for the coronation.

212
00:15:09,548 --> 00:15:12,751
Remove the Stone of Shame.

213
00:15:12,968 --> 00:15:16,966
Attach the Stone of Triumph!

214
00:15:33,989 --> 00:15:35,697
Mental note: Don't overdo this.

215
00:15:42,539 --> 00:15:43,571
Peekaboo!

216
00:15:48,587 --> 00:15:50,544
I always wondered
if there was a God.

217
00:15:50,714 --> 00:15:53,549
And now I know.
There is, and it's me.

218
00:15:53,717 --> 00:15:57,585
- You're not a god, Homer.
- Remember, Dad, all glory is fleeting.

219
00:15:57,763 --> 00:16:00,680
- So?
- Beware the Ides of March.

220
00:16:00,849 --> 00:16:02,509
- No.
- I know you're happy now...

221
00:16:02,685 --> 00:16:05,520
...but it won't last forever.
- Everything lasts forever.

222
00:16:05,688 --> 00:16:10,650
Getting what you want all the time
will leave you unfulfilled and joyless.

223
00:16:10,234 --> 00:16:11,562
Remove the girl.

224
00:16:11,777 --> 00:16:16,320
You're not with your Stonecutters. There
are no lackeys around to carry out your...

225
00:16:23,831 --> 00:16:25,740
Another strike for the Chosen One!

226
00:16:25,916 --> 00:16:27,909
Hurrah!

227
00:16:34,258 --> 00:16:35,752
That's just an excellent break.

228
00:16:35,926 --> 00:16:38,547
- Oh, most assuredly.
- Absolutely.

229
00:16:46,312 --> 00:16:48,185
- I'm out.
- No, no, no. Homer...

230
00:16:48,355 --> 00:16:51,475
...you have a royal sampler.

231
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:54,734
Oh, I win again, don't I?

232
00:16:55,154 --> 00:16:57,609
- Good one.
- Nice hand, Chosen One.

233
00:16:57,781 --> 00:17:00,700
You know, I think you guys
are letting me win.

234
00:17:00,242 --> 00:17:03,825
No! No! No!

235
00:17:03,996 --> 00:17:06,451
From now on I want you
to be honest with me.

236
00:17:06,623 --> 00:17:08,450
I mean, I'm not perfect, right?

237
00:17:10,878 --> 00:17:13,962
- Yeah.
- Well...

238
00:17:18,302 --> 00:17:19,962
Run.

239
00:17:25,184 --> 00:17:27,971
The grand exalted leader
requests a moment of your time.

240
00:17:28,562 --> 00:17:30,685
Class dismissed.

241
00:17:34,318 --> 00:17:37,438
Lisa, you were right.
My happiness is fading.

242
00:17:37,613 --> 00:17:41,361
You're experiencing spiritual emptiness
because your power has isolated you...

243
00:17:41,533 --> 00:17:45,317
...from other human beings.
- What do you mean, isolated?

244
00:17:47,164 --> 00:17:51,328
Well, maybe you could reach out to
the community and help other people.

245
00:17:51,835 --> 00:17:54,457
I could help others.

246
00:17:54,630 --> 00:18:00,860
I'll get a bunch of monkeys, dress them
up and make them reenact the Civil War.

247
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:01,920
Dad, that doesn't help people.

248
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,381
Couldn't hurt. Unless the monkeys
started hurting people.

249
00:18:05,557 --> 00:18:08,950
Which they almost certainly would.

250
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:14,434
Brothers. Brothers!

251
00:18:16,485 --> 00:18:19,936
Brothers, I've learned
a wonderful lesson.

252
00:18:20,114 --> 00:18:24,776
Helping others makes our own lives
better and makes us better people.

253
00:18:24,952 --> 00:18:28,720
So instead of just shooting pool
and drinking beer...

254
00:18:28,247 --> 00:18:32,909
...let us Stonecutters use what we have
to help the less fortunate.

255
00:18:36,672 --> 00:18:40,372
He's gone mad with power,
like that Albert Schweitzer guy.

256
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,590
Oh, for the love of God!

257
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:54,428
Somebody get the Jaws of Life!

258
00:18:58,402 --> 00:19:01,522
Higher! Higher!

259
00:19:01,697 --> 00:19:04,235
Oh, I'll give you higher,
my filthy little urchin.

260
00:19:09,455 --> 00:19:12,124
You've won this round.

261
00:19:17,171 --> 00:19:20,255
Oh, thank you, Mr. Simpson.

262
00:19:20,424 --> 00:19:22,713
It looks so much better.

263
00:19:22,885 --> 00:19:25,969
A beautiful sky blue.

264
00:19:27,973 --> 00:19:32,884
You were right, Lisa.
I've never felt so spiritually fulfilled.

265
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:35,897
And with my brothers
the Stonecutters behind me...

266
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:39,979
...this is the beginning
of a better world for all of us.

267
00:19:40,194 --> 00:19:42,436
- We gotta kill him!
- Take it easy, Moe.

268
00:19:42,613 --> 00:19:46,824
Let's hear from the Stonecutter World
Council before we act too rashly.

269
00:19:46,992 --> 00:19:48,403
- Kill him.
- Kill him.

270
00:19:48,577 --> 00:19:50,949
- Kill the fool!
- Afraid I have to disagree...

271
00:19:51,121 --> 00:19:55,867
...with Orville, Jack and Mister. Can't
we just do something to his voice box?

272
00:19:56,850 --> 00:19:57,994
We might as well face the truth.

273
00:19:58,170 --> 00:20:02,370
As long as we're Stonecutters,
he will control our lives.

274
00:20:02,216 --> 00:20:06,593
Maybe. But maybe we don't
wanna be Stonecutters no more.

275
00:20:12,226 --> 00:20:15,844
This is much better than
the old Stonecutter hall.

276
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:19,141
Silence. I now call to order
the first meeting...

277
00:20:19,316 --> 00:20:22,353
...of the ancient, mystic society of...

278
00:20:22,528 --> 00:20:23,856
...No Homers.

279
00:20:26,824 --> 00:20:28,733
Hey, fellas. Can I join?

280
00:20:28,909 --> 00:20:32,112
Sorry. No Homers.

281
00:20:33,956 --> 00:20:35,616
Loyal Stonecutters...

282
00:20:35,791 --> 00:20:39,539
...let us begin our reenactment
of the Battle of Gettysburg.

283
00:20:42,172 --> 00:20:45,755
Homer, you can't just keep hanging out
with these Colobus monkeys.

284
00:20:45,926 --> 00:20:48,417
Somebody's gonna get parasites.

285
00:20:48,595 --> 00:20:52,470
Oh, Marge, kids, I miss my club.

286
00:20:52,224 --> 00:20:55,110
Oh, Homie.

287
00:20:55,185 --> 00:20:59,313
You know, you are a member
of a very exclusive club.

288
00:20:59,481 --> 00:21:03,313
- The Black Panthers?
- No, the family Simpson...

289
00:21:03,485 --> 00:21:05,858
...which has just five members.

290
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:09,944
And only two of those members
have special rings.

291
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:12,365
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

292
00:21:13,162 --> 00:21:14,953
I meant our wedding rings!

293
00:21:16,749 --> 00:21:18,706
You know, Marge, you're right.

294
00:21:18,876 --> 00:21:24,581
The Simpson family is the best
possible club I could belong to.

295
00:21:29,678 --> 00:21:32,383
This club better be worth it.

296
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:35,506
All right, all right, it's Lisa's turn.

297
00:21:46,445 --> 00:21:50,443
Who controls the British crown?
Who keeps the metric system down?

298
00:21:50,616 --> 00:21:54,696
We do
We do

299
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:58,915
Who keeps Atlantis off the maps?
Who keeps the Martians under wraps?

300
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:03,163
We do
We do

301
00:22:03,337 --> 00:22:07,335
Who holds back the electric car?

302
00:22:07,508 --> 00:22:11,588
Who makes Steve Guttenberg a star?

303
00:22:11,762 --> 00:22:15,807
We do
We do

304
00:22:15,974 --> 00:22:19,972
Who robs cavefish of their sight?
Who rigs every Oscar night?

305
00:22:20,145 --> 00:22:23,146
We do

306
00:22:23,315 --> 00:22:27,182
We do

307
00:22:28,195 --> 00:22:30,690
Shut up.

308
00:22:31,281 --> 00:22:33,357
