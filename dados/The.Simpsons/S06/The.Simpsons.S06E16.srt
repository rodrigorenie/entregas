1
00:00:06,026 --> 00:00:07,650
Bart vs. Australia

2
00:00:54,446 --> 00:00:57,482
Go, toothpaste. Go!
Move your pasty, white butt!

3
00:00:57,657 --> 00:01:00,064
Come on, shampoo!
You can do it!

4
00:01:00,243 --> 00:01:02,816
I won your stupid
bathroom-products race!

5
00:01:02,995 --> 00:01:05,699
No fair. You only won
because you had the inside track.

6
00:01:05,873 --> 00:01:07,580
If the water had spun
the other way...

7
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:10,454
It never spins the other way.
In the Northern Hemisphere...

8
00:01:10,627 --> 00:01:12,536
...water always drains
counter-clockwise.

9
00:01:12,712 --> 00:01:14,289
It's called the Coriolis effect.

10
00:01:14,464 --> 00:01:17,749
No way.
Water doesn't obey your rules.

11
00:01:17,967 --> 00:01:20,540
It goes where it wants.
Like me, babe.

12
00:01:20,762 --> 00:01:24,379
Yes, Bart.
Why don't you try it and see.

13
00:01:27,101 --> 00:01:29,887
I know I've seen it go the other way.

14
00:01:30,062 --> 00:01:32,469
Ah, faithful toilet.

15
00:01:32,647 --> 00:01:34,556
You'll prove me right.

16
00:01:41,948 --> 00:01:45,114
I'm singing in the show...

17
00:01:45,284 --> 00:01:47,655
Hot! Cold!

18
00:01:47,828 --> 00:01:51,907
Hot! Cold! Hot!
Who's doing that?

19
00:01:54,709 --> 00:01:58,658
Oh, for Pete's sake, Bart,
use the plunger.

20
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,213
Bart, water will only go the other way
in the Southern Hemisphere.

21
00:02:02,383 --> 00:02:05,134
What the hell
is the Southern Hemisphere?

22
00:02:05,303 --> 00:02:07,295
Haven't you ever looked at your globe?

23
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:13,601
See? The Southern Hemisphere is made
up of everything below the equa...

24
00:02:15,645 --> 00:02:17,637
This line.

25
00:02:18,106 --> 00:02:21,439
So down there in, say, Argentina...

26
00:02:21,609 --> 00:02:24,811
...or Rand McNally,
all their water runs backwards?

27
00:02:25,863 --> 00:02:29,480
In fact, in Rand McNally,
they wear hats on their feet...

28
00:02:29,658 --> 00:02:32,943
...and hamburgers eat people.
- Cool.

29
00:02:52,304 --> 00:02:53,632
Hello, Southern Hemisphere?

30
00:02:53,806 --> 00:02:55,928
Which way does the water go
in your toilet?

31
00:02:56,099 --> 00:02:58,636
Just a minute, I'll check.

32
00:03:05,108 --> 00:03:06,436
Nuts.

33
00:03:10,404 --> 00:03:14,104
Please to repeat again, and I will
translating for the el presidente.

34
00:03:14,325 --> 00:03:17,242
Which way does the water turn
in your toilet?

35
00:03:27,545 --> 00:03:31,079
I can't get a straight answer
out of this crazy hemisphere.

36
00:03:39,181 --> 00:03:41,090
- Nuisance phone.

37
00:03:48,189 --> 00:03:50,430
Bart, you can't actually call
these places.

38
00:03:50,608 --> 00:03:54,936
Don't you know how expensive
international calls are?

39
00:03:55,654 --> 00:03:58,654
Hello, operator,
I'd like to make a collect call...

40
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:00,527
...to Australia.

41
00:04:08,541 --> 00:04:12,040
This is the operator.
Will you accept a collect call from...?

42
00:04:12,211 --> 00:04:15,710
Yes, this is Dr. Bart Simpson of
the International Drainage Commission.

43
00:04:15,881 --> 00:04:18,087
- It's an emergency.
- Lf it's an emergency...

44
00:04:18,259 --> 00:04:20,880
We understand drains in your area
have malfunctioned...

45
00:04:21,053 --> 00:04:24,587
...sucking in people and whatnot.
- Willikers! That's awful!

46
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:27,765
Indeed. We need you to check
your sinks and toilets...

47
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:32,595
...and tell us which way the water
is going. And please stand clear!

48
00:04:38,944 --> 00:04:42,063
The fixtures, they're all
draining clockwise, sir.

49
00:04:42,239 --> 00:04:44,776
She was right.
Stupid Lisa, science queen.

50
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:48,567
Well, why don't you just check
your neighbors' drains. I'll hold.

51
00:04:53,124 --> 00:04:57,452
Hey, Bart, the bakery caught fire
and all of downtown smells like cookies.

52
00:04:57,628 --> 00:04:58,956
Want to go smell?

53
00:04:59,463 --> 00:05:02,416
Yes. Yes, I do.

54
00:05:09,514 --> 00:05:12,550
Hello, sir? Sir?

55
00:05:12,726 --> 00:05:16,805
I've returned from the Quilamaguery's
place. They're draining clockwise too.

56
00:05:16,979 --> 00:05:19,101
Draining?
I don't care about that anymore.

57
00:05:19,273 --> 00:05:20,731
Are we in any dang...

58
00:05:25,904 --> 00:05:30,945
"Burkina Faso"? "Disputed Zone"?
Who called all these weird places?

59
00:05:31,118 --> 00:05:33,027
Quiet, it might be you.
I can 't remember.

60
00:05:33,203 --> 00:05:36,654
- No, I'm gonna ask Marge.
- No! No! Why embarrass us both?

61
00:05:36,831 --> 00:05:39,867
Just write a check and I'll release
some more endorphins.

62
00:05:42,753 --> 00:05:46,335
Nine hundred dollary-doos?! Tobias!

63
00:05:46,507 --> 00:05:50,041
Did you accept a six-hour collect call
from the States?

64
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:51,540
It was an emergency call...

65
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:55,053
...from the International Drainage
Commission in Springfield.

66
00:05:55,265 --> 00:05:58,384
Oh, my God! There's nothing wrong
with the bidet, is there?

67
00:06:00,061 --> 00:06:02,100
- Hello?
- Right, I'm calling all the way...

68
00:06:02,271 --> 00:06:04,097
...from Squatter's Crog, Australia.

69
00:06:04,273 --> 00:06:08,566
And I want to speak
to Dr. Bart Simpson right now.

70
00:06:08,777 --> 00:06:10,899
- Hold, please.
- All right, but I don't...

71
00:06:11,071 --> 00:06:13,442
Hello. Burt Stanton speaking.

72
00:06:13,615 --> 00:06:16,485
I said, Bart Simpson!
What kind of company is this?

73
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:17,988
Bart Simpson's office.

74
00:06:18,161 --> 00:06:20,651
Thank the great, good Lord.
Look, I was just saying...

75
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:22,822
One moment, please.

76
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:27,450
Who do they think I am,
some stupid Aussie drongo?

77
00:06:27,628 --> 00:06:29,205
Bleeding Yanks. I ought to...

78
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:32,464
This is Bart Simpson.
Can I help you, ma'am?

79
00:06:32,633 --> 00:06:34,958
Yeah...
My name is Bruno Drundridge, right.

80
00:06:35,135 --> 00:06:37,008
You owe me $900, mate!

81
00:06:37,178 --> 00:06:40,677
- No, you owe me $900!
- All right, you...

82
00:06:41,432 --> 00:06:43,839
You're just some punk kid, aren't you?

83
00:06:44,018 --> 00:06:48,346
You picked the wrong guy
to tangle with here, mate.

84
00:06:48,522 --> 00:06:51,807
I don't think so.
You're all the way in Australia.

85
00:06:51,984 --> 00:06:55,601
Hey, I think I hear
a dingo eating your baby.

86
00:06:57,489 --> 00:07:01,272
That's it! I'm gonna report this
to me member of Parliament.

87
00:07:01,451 --> 00:07:02,993
Hey, Gus!

88
00:07:03,161 --> 00:07:05,236
I got something to report to you!

89
00:07:05,455 --> 00:07:08,028
That's a bloody outrage, it is!

90
00:07:08,207 --> 00:07:12,251
I'm gonna take this all the way
to the prime minister!

91
00:07:14,129 --> 00:07:17,877
Hey, Mr. Prime Minister!

92
00:07:18,091 --> 00:07:19,371
Andy!

93
00:07:20,051 --> 00:07:22,720
Aye, mates. What's the good word?

94
00:07:24,514 --> 00:07:26,506
"Mr. Simpson," blah, blah.

95
00:07:26,682 --> 00:07:28,970
"Misrepresentation over telephone..."

96
00:07:29,143 --> 00:07:31,052
"Sincerely," some Australian jerk.

97
00:07:40,362 --> 00:07:42,769
Hey, I need that!

98
00:07:42,947 --> 00:07:44,856
"Office of the Solicitor General"?

99
00:07:45,033 --> 00:07:46,942
"Office of the Prime Minister"?

100
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:50,991
"Hopping Mad Collection Agency"?
What is all this stuff?

101
00:07:51,205 --> 00:07:55,332
Nothing. Some stupid country
thinks I owe them money.

102
00:07:55,501 --> 00:07:58,537
Bart, you better talk
to Mom and Dad about this.

103
00:07:59,004 --> 00:08:02,668
Hey, guys? Just so you don't hear
any wild rumors, I'm being indicted...

104
00:08:02,841 --> 00:08:06,541
...for fraud in Australia.
- That's no reason to block the TV.

105
00:08:06,719 --> 00:08:08,296
Oh, my.

106
00:08:11,057 --> 00:08:15,848
Bart, did you trick an Australian boy
into accepting a $900 collect call?

107
00:08:16,061 --> 00:08:17,471
Yes'm.

108
00:08:17,688 --> 00:08:23,026
There it is, Australia. I'll be damned.

109
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,230
Look at this country.
"You-are-gay."

110
00:08:31,701 --> 00:08:35,650
Oh, my. Hello. I'm Evan Conover
with the U.S. State Department.

111
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:41,618
"Undersecretary for International
Protocol, Brat and Punk Division."

112
00:08:41,835 --> 00:08:45,369
Unfortunately, your little escapade
could not have come at a worse time.

113
00:08:45,589 --> 00:08:49,337
Americo-Australianian relations
are at an all-time low.

114
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:54,758
In the late 1980s, the U.S. Experienced
a short-lived infatuation...

115
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:57,515
...with Australian culture.

116
00:08:59,185 --> 00:09:01,307
The Aussies thought
this would be permanent.

117
00:09:02,688 --> 00:09:05,558
I know those words,
but that sign makes no sense.

118
00:09:05,732 --> 00:09:08,851
Anyway, the down-under fad fizzled,
and the diplomatic climate...

119
00:09:09,027 --> 00:09:11,019
...turned absolutely frosty.

120
00:09:12,697 --> 00:09:14,903
Let's pretend we didn't see that.

121
00:09:15,783 --> 00:09:19,282
And Bart's childish taunting
agitated the Aussies further.

122
00:09:19,495 --> 00:09:23,990
Oh, he'll agitate you. He sure will.

123
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:30,792
- What can we do for you?
- It's too late...

124
00:09:30,964 --> 00:09:32,374
...to pay back the money.

125
00:09:32,549 --> 00:09:35,218
But as a sign of good faith
to our Australian friends...

126
00:09:35,385 --> 00:09:37,626
...we'd like to imprison Bart
for five years.

127
00:09:38,054 --> 00:09:40,805
That's tough but fair.
Boy, go with the man.

128
00:09:40,973 --> 00:09:43,642
No, no, no!

129
00:09:43,851 --> 00:09:48,263
I'm not gonna have my son go to jail
over some silly tiff with Australia.

130
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,394
You'll just have to find some
other country to have relations with.

131
00:09:52,609 --> 00:09:55,526
You're sure, now?
The prison train is sailing.

132
00:09:55,737 --> 00:09:58,773
Okay, I'm not hearing a lot
of support for prison.

133
00:09:58,948 --> 00:10:00,905
There is one other option.

134
00:10:01,075 --> 00:10:05,403
They'll drop the charges if Bart
makes a public apology in Australia.

135
00:10:05,621 --> 00:10:08,870
All Bart has to do is apologize
and we get a free trip to Australia?

136
00:10:10,042 --> 00:10:12,532
I can handle that.
I'm an expert at phony apologies.

137
00:10:12,711 --> 00:10:14,169
- Bart!
- I'm sorry.

138
00:10:14,337 --> 00:10:16,163
That's better.

139
00:10:49,328 --> 00:10:52,412
We left at 1:30 p.m., Monday.
What time is it now?

140
00:10:52,623 --> 00:10:54,745
It's 6:45 a.m., next Wednesday.

141
00:10:54,916 --> 00:10:58,249
You may also be interested to know
that it's summer here, not winter.

142
00:11:00,255 --> 00:11:03,623
What does that sign say? I thought
they spoke English in this country.

143
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:06,966
It says you can't bring in
outside plants or animals.

144
00:11:07,178 --> 00:11:12,385
Any foreign creature you bring in
could upset the environmental balance.

145
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:17,678
Sorry, girl, I don't want to get in
any more trouble down here.

146
00:11:18,022 --> 00:11:20,773
I'll pick you up on the way home.

147
00:11:37,416 --> 00:11:40,037
Hey, are you, like, one
of those English guards...

148
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:42,961
...who can't laugh or smile
or anything?

149
00:11:48,176 --> 00:11:50,548
No, sir! U.S. Marine Corps, sir!

150
00:11:53,431 --> 00:11:56,052
Oh, yeah. This is the life.

151
00:11:56,268 --> 00:11:59,767
Boy, next summer can you commit
some fraud in Orlando, Florida?

152
00:11:59,938 --> 00:12:01,764
I'm way ahead of you, Dad.

153
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:05,143
Knock. Simpsons, I'd like you
to meet our ambassador...

154
00:12:05,318 --> 00:12:06,977
...the Honorable Averil Ward.

155
00:12:07,195 --> 00:12:10,646
Hello. Now, everything is all set
for Bart's apology.

156
00:12:10,865 --> 00:12:13,700
Mr. Conover will meet you
at the Parliament House at 3 p.m.

157
00:12:13,868 --> 00:12:15,148
Any questions?

158
00:12:15,328 --> 00:12:17,569
- Do the toilets go backwards in here?
- No.

159
00:12:17,789 --> 00:12:20,410
To combat homesickness,
we have a device that makes...

160
00:12:20,625 --> 00:12:22,498
...them swirl the correct American way.

161
00:12:28,466 --> 00:12:32,084
Sweet land of liberty

162
00:12:32,261 --> 00:12:35,464
Of thee I sing

163
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:43,141
Hey, GI Joe, your sign's broken.
We're already in Australia.

164
00:12:43,355 --> 00:12:46,391
Actually, sir, the embassy is considered
American soil, sir.

165
00:12:46,609 --> 00:12:49,645
Really? Look, boy.
Now I'm in Australia.

166
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:52,393
Now I'm in America.
Australia. America.

167
00:12:52,573 --> 00:12:54,482
- Australia.
- I get it, Dad.

168
00:12:54,658 --> 00:12:57,148
Homer, that's enough.

169
00:12:58,162 --> 00:13:00,783
Here in America,
we don't tolerate that crap, sir.

170
00:13:04,877 --> 00:13:08,245
"Australia was founded as a
settlement for British convicts."

171
00:13:08,422 --> 00:13:10,248
Lisa, watch your camera.

172
00:13:17,222 --> 00:13:18,502
You call that a knife?

173
00:13:19,349 --> 00:13:21,175
This is a knife.

174
00:13:21,351 --> 00:13:25,134
- That's not a knife. That's a spoon.
- All right, all right. You win.

175
00:13:25,897 --> 00:13:28,304
I see you've played
knifie-spoonie before.

176
00:13:30,276 --> 00:13:35,270
Hey, give me one of those famous
giant beers I've heard so much about.

177
00:13:35,448 --> 00:13:36,906
Something wrong, Yank?

178
00:13:37,075 --> 00:13:40,325
No. It's pretty big, I guess.

179
00:13:40,745 --> 00:13:43,662
- I'll just have a cup of coffee.
- Beer it is.

180
00:13:43,831 --> 00:13:45,373
No, I said, coffee.

181
00:13:45,541 --> 00:13:48,458
- Beer?
- Coffee.

182
00:13:48,628 --> 00:13:50,205
Beer?

183
00:13:50,379 --> 00:13:54,459
- C-O...
- B-E...

184
00:14:00,056 --> 00:14:02,891
We'll meet you boys back here
for dinner. Good luck, honey.

185
00:14:04,393 --> 00:14:07,062
Bart, I'm sorry I'm gonna miss
your public humiliation.

186
00:14:07,229 --> 00:14:11,522
But the Walambaloo Dirt Monument
is just too exciting to pass up.

187
00:14:18,449 --> 00:14:22,493
Hear ye! Hear ye!
This session will now come to order.

188
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:25,491
With the cooperation
of the U.S. Department of State...

189
00:14:25,664 --> 00:14:27,786
...we have present today
one Bart Simpson.

190
00:14:31,044 --> 00:14:33,369
I believe he has something to say.

191
00:14:33,547 --> 00:14:35,254
Bart?

192
00:14:43,223 --> 00:14:44,765
I'm sorry.

193
00:14:44,933 --> 00:14:48,099
I'm sorry for what I did
to your country.

194
00:14:49,729 --> 00:14:53,062
Well, you're free to go, Bart...

195
00:14:53,233 --> 00:14:54,775
...right after your
additional punishment.

196
00:14:56,945 --> 00:14:59,732
- Punishment!
- A mere apology would be a bit empty.

197
00:14:59,906 --> 00:15:01,815
Let the booting begin!

198
00:15:02,033 --> 00:15:04,784
- Booting?
- It's just a little kick in the bum.

199
00:15:21,594 --> 00:15:24,844
What kind of a sick country would
kick someone with a giant boot?

200
00:15:25,014 --> 00:15:28,548
Mr. Simpson, shush. Disparaging
the boot is a bootable offense.

201
00:15:28,726 --> 00:15:31,051
It's one of their proudest traditions.

202
00:15:36,317 --> 00:15:39,234
You sold us out, Conover!

203
00:15:48,036 --> 00:15:51,072
Stand back or I'll boot
your prime minister! I'll do it.

204
00:15:51,248 --> 00:15:53,821
So help me God, I'll boot him!

205
00:15:55,085 --> 00:15:56,744
When will you Australians learn?

206
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:59,671
In America,
we stopped using corporal punishment.

207
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:02,627
And things have never been better.
The streets are safe...

208
00:16:02,801 --> 00:16:06,004
...old people strut confidently through
the darkest alleys...

209
00:16:06,179 --> 00:16:10,472
...and the weak and nerdy are admired
for their computer-programming abilities.

210
00:16:10,642 --> 00:16:14,686
So like us,
let your children run wild and free...

211
00:16:14,854 --> 00:16:17,558
...because, as the old saying goes:

212
00:16:17,732 --> 00:16:21,314
"Let your children run wild and free."

213
00:16:21,528 --> 00:16:26,866
Now, boy, run back to the embassy!
Back to American soil!

214
00:16:30,078 --> 00:16:32,153
I'll stop them.

215
00:16:34,957 --> 00:16:37,329
Oh, no, it's coming back this way.

216
00:16:37,502 --> 00:16:40,953
That throwing stick stunt of yours
has boomeranged on us.

217
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:47,296
Hey, we can get away
in their pouches.

218
00:16:49,889 --> 00:16:51,798
It's not like in cartoons.

219
00:16:51,974 --> 00:16:54,547
Yeah. There's a lot more mucus.

220
00:16:59,315 --> 00:17:01,603
Mom, you said I could
have one souvenir, right?

221
00:17:01,775 --> 00:17:03,055
Well, I want a didjeridu.

222
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:12,736
That seems very noisy and expensive
for a souvenir.

223
00:17:12,953 --> 00:17:16,784
Why don't you get this nice cap.
It's clever, just like you.

224
00:17:19,918 --> 00:17:25,160
Get out! Get out! Shoo! Shoo!
Get out of here!

225
00:17:25,382 --> 00:17:28,881
These bloody things are everywhere.
They're in the lift, the lorry...

226
00:17:29,052 --> 00:17:31,625
...in the bon whizzer,
and the Malonga Gilderchuck.

227
00:17:31,847 --> 00:17:35,891
They're like kangaroos.
But they're reptiles, they is.

228
00:17:36,101 --> 00:17:38,556
We have them in America.
They're called bullfrogs.

229
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:40,762
What? That's an odd name.

230
00:17:40,939 --> 00:17:43,227
I'd have called them chazwazzers.

231
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,732
Lisa!

232
00:17:47,946 --> 00:17:49,772
Marge!

233
00:17:58,831 --> 00:18:00,159
The Simpsons.

234
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:02,788
Well, they're not getting back in here.

235
00:18:17,183 --> 00:18:20,018
I can't believe our government
would set up Bart like that.

236
00:18:20,186 --> 00:18:23,021
I'm very angry
at the State Department right now.

237
00:18:23,189 --> 00:18:27,056
Yes, but... Please, we're about to reach
a breakthrough with the Aussies.

238
00:18:27,234 --> 00:18:30,982
Then it's agreed. During the bargaining
session, we each get two candy apples.

239
00:18:31,155 --> 00:18:33,313
All right, one candy and one caramel.

240
00:18:33,532 --> 00:18:35,571
Oh, for the love of criminy!
Give me that!

241
00:18:35,743 --> 00:18:38,447
I know Bart did something wrong.
But he's my son...

242
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:41,157
...and I'm going to punish him myself.

243
00:18:41,373 --> 00:18:43,579
Our countries
may have their differences...

244
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:46,953
...but as human beings,
I think we can all agree...

245
00:18:47,129 --> 00:18:52,004
...there's no substitute for the discipline
of a loving parent.

246
00:18:52,801 --> 00:18:54,592
He wants to talk to you.

247
00:18:54,803 --> 00:18:56,712
Hello.

248
00:18:57,055 --> 00:18:58,335
So we're in agreement.

249
00:18:58,515 --> 00:19:00,756
She won't be allowed
near the phone again.

250
00:19:01,977 --> 00:19:03,257
We did it.

251
00:19:03,478 --> 00:19:07,060
We've worked out a compromise
that will allow both nations to save face.

252
00:19:07,273 --> 00:19:08,767
We've argued them down to...

253
00:19:08,942 --> 00:19:10,222
...a booting.
- What?

254
00:19:10,443 --> 00:19:14,025
The prime minister just wants
to kick you once through the gate...

255
00:19:14,197 --> 00:19:16,948
...with a regular shoe.
- I believe it's a wingtip.

256
00:19:17,116 --> 00:19:20,152
No deal.
This is my son we're talking about.

257
00:19:20,328 --> 00:19:23,531
Sure, he's not perfect,
but who is in this workaday world?

258
00:19:23,748 --> 00:19:26,036
No. Mom, wait.

259
00:19:33,424 --> 00:19:37,635
It's time for me to bend over
and receive my destiny.

260
00:19:42,391 --> 00:19:47,218
Thank you, Bart. I promise
I won't make fun of you later for this.

261
00:19:47,396 --> 00:19:50,396
Show them what American butts
are made of, son.

262
00:19:54,987 --> 00:19:56,362
That's it, lad.

263
00:19:56,739 --> 00:19:59,858
This is for the
Commonwealth of Australia.

264
00:20:06,915 --> 00:20:09,156
And this is
for the United States of America.

265
00:20:26,643 --> 00:20:28,053
I'm glad you're okay, honey.

266
00:20:28,228 --> 00:20:31,063
But I wish you'd chosen a more
tasteful way to be patriotic.

267
00:20:31,231 --> 00:20:34,730
I'm impressed you were able
to write so legibly on your own butt.

268
00:20:46,287 --> 00:20:49,240
All right, mates, let them have it!

269
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:55,125
Hey, do we get to land
on an aircraft carrier?

270
00:20:55,296 --> 00:20:58,629
No, sir. The closest vessel
is the USS Walter Mondale.

271
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,717
It's a laundry ship.
They'll take you the rest of the way.

272
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:19,187
Hey, look.
Those frogs are eating all their crops.

273
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:27,283
Well, that's what happens
when you introduce foreign species...

274
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:30,240
...into an ecosystem
that can't handle them.
