1
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,893
Lemon of Troy

2
00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:40,428
"Wet cement."

3
00:00:40,638 --> 00:00:44,700
Is there any sweeter sign?
Well, maybe "high voltage."

4
00:00:48,687 --> 00:00:52,519
Hello, son. You want to try
this flying motorcycle I just invented?

5
00:00:52,691 --> 00:00:54,850
- No time.
- Okay.

6
00:00:57,112 --> 00:01:00,300
This is for the ages.

7
00:01:01,742 --> 00:01:04,778
Like Stonehenge,
this site will forever be a mystery.

8
00:01:06,455 --> 00:01:07,783
Who was Bart?

9
00:01:07,956 --> 00:01:10,874
And how did he manage
to write his name in solid cement?

10
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:14,750
He must've been smarter than his sister
Lisa, about whom we know nothing.

11
00:01:14,922 --> 00:01:17,674
Say, let's bring him back to life
by using technology.

12
00:01:18,842 --> 00:01:20,171
Ay caramba!

13
00:01:27,309 --> 00:01:31,389
- What's normal to him amazes us.
- He will be our new god.

14
00:01:38,195 --> 00:01:41,315
Good, somebody's shadow.
I'll just turn and brag about my work.

15
00:01:42,658 --> 00:01:45,742
Bart, you've graffito-tagged
public property.

16
00:01:45,953 --> 00:01:47,661
It was an accident.

17
00:01:48,205 --> 00:01:50,826
I can't believe you vandalized
your own hometown, Bart.

18
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:54,360
- What would Jebediah Springfield say?
- He'd be cool with it.

19
00:01:54,253 --> 00:01:57,207
Homer, will you please help me
make a big deal of this?

20
00:01:57,423 --> 00:02:01,420
What for? Nobody cared when Bogart
defaced that sidewalk in Hollywood.

21
00:02:01,635 --> 00:02:04,340
Well, I'm just shocked
by this whole family.

22
00:02:04,513 --> 00:02:07,860
Whatever happened
to good old-fashioned town pride?

23
00:02:07,308 --> 00:02:09,715
It's been going down
since the lake caught fire.

24
00:02:09,935 --> 00:02:14,348
Now, just a darn minute.
This town is a part of who you are.

25
00:02:14,523 --> 00:02:17,607
This is a Springfield Isotopes cap.

26
00:02:17,776 --> 00:02:20,813
When you wear it,
you're wearing Springfield.

27
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:24,648
When you eat a fish from our river,
you're eating Springfield.

28
00:02:24,825 --> 00:02:29,820
When you make lemonade from
our trees, you're drinking Springfield.

29
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:33,750
Mom, when you give that lecture,
you're boring Springfield.

30
00:02:33,292 --> 00:02:36,162
You have roots in this town,
and you ought to show respect.

31
00:02:36,378 --> 00:02:37,837
This town is a part of us all.

32
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,496
A part of us all. A part of us all.

33
00:02:40,716 --> 00:02:43,337
Sorry to repeat myself,
but it'll help you remember.

34
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:46,927
This town is a part of us all.

35
00:02:47,139 --> 00:02:49,547
A part of us all. A part of us all.

36
00:02:49,725 --> 00:02:51,634
Wow, that does work.

37
00:02:55,105 --> 00:02:58,142
- Hey, gonna win some this season?
- Gonna try.

38
00:03:05,157 --> 00:03:09,321
When it comes to catching trout,
nothing beats the German light infantry.

39
00:03:09,495 --> 00:03:10,823
Beautiful, aren't they?

40
00:03:10,996 --> 00:03:14,330
Yep. I'm gonna huck them at cars.

41
00:03:19,421 --> 00:03:21,497
Hey, Milhouse.
How's the lemonade business?

42
00:03:21,674 --> 00:03:24,425
It's clearly booming, Bart.

43
00:03:25,844 --> 00:03:28,632
I don't even want any.
I just bought a pity glass.

44
00:03:28,806 --> 00:03:32,506
We've squozen our whole supply.
To the lemon tree!

45
00:03:43,153 --> 00:03:45,941
Thar she grows.

46
00:03:48,909 --> 00:03:52,658
You know, Milhouse, I've been thinking.
This town ain't so bad.

47
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:56,281
Good friends, lots of lemons,
numerous angel sightings.

48
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:00,367
When you get right down to it,
Springfield's a pretty cool place to live.

49
00:04:00,546 --> 00:04:02,538
Springfield sucks.

50
00:04:04,258 --> 00:04:06,500
Hey, stop talking bad
about my town, man.

51
00:04:06,677 --> 00:04:09,298
- Why don't you make me.
- I don't make trash, I burn it.

52
00:04:09,513 --> 00:04:12,847
- Then I guess you're a garbage man.
- I know you are, but what am I?

53
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:15,632
- A garbage man.
- Oh, I know you are, but what am I?

54
00:04:15,853 --> 00:04:18,426
- A garbage man.
- I know you are, but what am I?

55
00:04:18,647 --> 00:04:20,854
- A garbage man.
- Takes one to know one.

56
00:04:22,109 --> 00:04:23,852
- Checkmate.
- Hey, kid.

57
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,186
Stop wearing your backpack
over one shoulder.

58
00:04:26,363 --> 00:04:30,231
- We invented that. Copycat.
- You copied us.

59
00:04:30,451 --> 00:04:33,820
Step over this line and say that.
I'll kick your butt...

60
00:04:33,996 --> 00:04:35,324
...at Nintendo.

61
00:04:36,248 --> 00:04:38,656
I just put a rock in your crummy town.

62
00:04:38,876 --> 00:04:42,420
That's a crud rock.
It belongs in Crudtown.

63
00:04:45,924 --> 00:04:51,299
Look at the weak little baby.
You're stupid, you stupid, weak baby.

64
00:04:51,472 --> 00:04:54,841
- Come on, let's get out of here.
- Hey, they're taking our lemons.

65
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:56,891
We can't spare a single one.

66
00:05:01,398 --> 00:05:04,518
You just got citric acid in my eye.

67
00:05:04,693 --> 00:05:07,564
You'll pay for that, Springfield.

68
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:11,982
Some things never change.

69
00:05:12,201 --> 00:05:14,407
Hey, everybody, an old man's talking.

70
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:18,788
Grampa's the name.

71
00:05:18,999 --> 00:05:23,578
Did you know this tree dates
back to frontier times?

72
00:05:26,215 --> 00:05:27,543
Shut up!

73
00:05:27,758 --> 00:05:32,384
It all began when Jebediah Springfield
first came to these lands...

74
00:05:32,554 --> 00:05:36,932
...with his partner,
Shelbyville Manhattan.

75
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:43,938
People, our search is over.

76
00:05:44,149 --> 00:05:47,649
On this site, we shall build a new town,
where we can worship freely...

77
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:52,114
...govern justly and grow vast fields
of hemp for making rope and blankets.

78
00:05:52,282 --> 00:05:55,533
- Yes, and marry our cousins.
- I was...

79
00:05:55,703 --> 00:05:59,451
What are you talking about, Shelbyville?
Why would we marry our cousins?

80
00:05:59,623 --> 00:06:01,201
Because they're so attractive.

81
00:06:01,375 --> 00:06:03,783
I thought that was
the whole point of this journey.

82
00:06:03,961 --> 00:06:05,621
- Absolutely not.
- I tell you...

83
00:06:05,796 --> 00:06:09,461
...I won't live in a town that robs men
of the right to marry their cousins.

84
00:06:09,675 --> 00:06:12,470
Well, then we'll form our own town.

85
00:06:12,219 --> 00:06:16,860
Who will come and live a life devoted
to chastity, abstinence...

86
00:06:16,265 --> 00:06:19,100
...and a flavorless mush
I call rootmarm?

87
00:06:28,694 --> 00:06:32,526
The town of Springfield
was born on that day.

88
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:37,982
And to mark that sweet moment,
our people planted this lemon tree...

89
00:06:38,203 --> 00:06:41,619
...lemons being the sweetest fruit
available at the time.

90
00:06:45,878 --> 00:06:49,211
Those Shelbyville kids think they're hot.
You know what? They're not.

91
00:06:49,381 --> 00:06:52,667
- I really agree with you on this one, Bart.
- Class, please.

92
00:06:52,885 --> 00:06:54,593
If you don't learn Roman numerals...

93
00:06:54,762 --> 00:06:57,134
...you'll never know
when movies were copyrighted.

94
00:06:57,348 --> 00:07:00,183
Come quick. Something's happened.
No time to explain.

95
00:07:00,392 --> 00:07:02,515
No, children. No.

96
00:07:02,728 --> 00:07:06,476
Your education is important.
Roman numerals, et cetera.

97
00:07:06,649 --> 00:07:09,210
Whatever. I tried.

98
00:07:12,154 --> 00:07:15,274
Are you sure it wouldn't be faster
to just tell us what happened?

99
00:07:15,449 --> 00:07:19,613
No. I said there's no time to explain,
and I stick by that.

100
00:07:21,664 --> 00:07:23,407
The lemon tree's gone.

101
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:26,574
And the tracks appear to lead
into Shelbyville.

102
00:07:26,794 --> 00:07:29,332
Oh, look, a clue. A candy-bar wrapper.

103
00:07:29,505 --> 00:07:32,624
Oh, they're always eating candy
in Shelbyville.

104
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,299
- They love the sweet taste.
- We gotta get that tree back.

105
00:07:36,512 --> 00:07:40,462
You mean going to Shelbyville?
We'll never make it out alive.

106
00:07:40,641 --> 00:07:45,102
That lemon tree's part of our town and,
as kids, the backbone of our economy.

107
00:07:45,312 --> 00:07:48,764
We'll get it back
or choke their rivers with our dead.

108
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:53,356
Where are you going, Bart?

109
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:56,904
Mom, you won't believe this, but
something you said got through to me.

110
00:07:58,283 --> 00:08:02,661
And now, I am going to teach
some kids a lesson.

111
00:08:02,871 --> 00:08:06,205
- I choose to take that literally.
- Death to Shelbyville!

112
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:10,420
Yes, Bart's a tutor now. Tute on, son.

113
00:08:10,587 --> 00:08:11,916
Tute on.

114
00:08:15,884 --> 00:08:19,170
Hey, Milhouse,
get your invasion supplies, and let's go.

115
00:08:24,768 --> 00:08:26,310
Get him. Come on.

116
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,109
- Where did he go?
- Over here, my friends.

117
00:08:32,276 --> 00:08:35,609
Or is it over here?

118
00:08:38,615 --> 00:08:40,158
Yeah.

119
00:08:41,869 --> 00:08:45,350
Here's how it goes. I'm the leader.
Milhouse is my loyal sidekick.

120
00:08:45,205 --> 00:08:47,412
Nelson's the tough guy.
Martin's the smart guy.

121
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:49,908
Todd's the religious guy
who ends up going crazy.

122
00:08:50,127 --> 00:08:51,290
And now...

123
00:08:51,462 --> 00:08:55,506
...the time has come to cross this line
into mystery and danger.

124
00:08:55,716 --> 00:08:59,299
To step out of childhood
and become men.

125
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:14,224
If you get lost, remember...

126
00:09:14,443 --> 00:09:18,571
...you can always find east
by staring directly at the sun.

127
00:09:18,781 --> 00:09:21,450
Here's a tip.
Put a pinch of sage in your boots...

128
00:09:21,617 --> 00:09:25,401
...and all day long,
a spicy scent is your reward.

129
00:09:26,664 --> 00:09:28,455
Oh, my gosh. Look.

130
00:09:28,624 --> 00:09:31,162
The fire hydrants here are yellow.

131
00:09:31,377 --> 00:09:33,749
This place is starting to freak me out.

132
00:09:33,962 --> 00:09:37,331
Danger coming. Behind us.

133
00:09:38,842 --> 00:09:42,211
What is it, boy? Is there something
behind that wall we should beat up?

134
00:09:42,388 --> 00:09:46,551
No time to check it out now.
We've got lemonade to sell.

135
00:09:48,394 --> 00:09:49,888
Radical.

136
00:09:50,771 --> 00:09:52,313
They're getting rich off us.

137
00:09:52,523 --> 00:09:54,681
And that kid with the backpack
said "radical."

138
00:09:54,858 --> 00:09:58,393
I say "radical."
That's my thing that I say.

139
00:09:58,612 --> 00:10:01,648
I feel like I'm gonna explode here.

140
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:07,770
It's lunchtime. Do you know
where your brother's tutoring?

141
00:10:07,705 --> 00:10:11,702
Tutoring? The only thing Bart's teaching
is guerrilla combat in Shelbyville.

142
00:10:11,917 --> 00:10:14,408
- You have a number we can reach him?
- No, Mom.

143
00:10:14,586 --> 00:10:17,457
Bart and some kids ran off
to wage war on Shelbyville.

144
00:10:19,133 --> 00:10:20,793
Homer, come quick.

145
00:10:20,968 --> 00:10:23,969
Bart's quit his tutoring job
and joined a violence gang.

146
00:10:26,307 --> 00:10:28,548
The trail has become indistinct.

147
00:10:28,726 --> 00:10:31,845
I suggest we split up
to cover more ground.

148
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:34,725
Good idea. Milhouse,
you and me will be Omega Team.

149
00:10:34,898 --> 00:10:37,389
Todd, you and Data
are Team Strike Force.

150
00:10:37,568 --> 00:10:42,111
- Nelson, that leaves you and Martin.
- Team Discovery Channel.

151
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:46,110
Your wussiness better come in handy.

152
00:10:49,663 --> 00:10:51,572
- What's going on?
- I want some answers.

153
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:54,875
Okay, folks, look,
I called the police captain in Shelbyville.

154
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,586
He says he hasn't seen our kids.

155
00:10:56,754 --> 00:10:59,245
But if they show up in the morgue,
he's gonna fax us.

156
00:10:59,465 --> 00:11:03,961
- Oh, man, I hate those Shelbyville jerks.
- Honey, I was born in Shelbyville.

157
00:11:04,136 --> 00:11:06,100
And it tears me up inside.

158
00:11:06,221 --> 00:11:09,507
This is my fault.
I tried to teach Bart about town pride.

159
00:11:09,683 --> 00:11:12,803
But the power of my words
filled him with a sort of madness.

160
00:11:12,978 --> 00:11:18,103
Marge, you can't blame all of Bart's
problems on your one little speech.

161
00:11:18,275 --> 00:11:19,900
If anything turned him bad...

162
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:23,438
...it's that time you let him wear
a bathing suit instead of underwear.

163
00:11:23,614 --> 00:11:28,359
- And let's not forget your little speech.
- Isn't there anything we can do?

164
00:11:28,535 --> 00:11:31,157
Yes, there is. Come on, everybody.

165
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:35,300
Let's go into Shelbyville
and get those kids back ourselves.

166
00:11:35,209 --> 00:11:36,952
I got an RV we can use.

167
00:11:37,169 --> 00:11:38,912
- Flanders'.
- Yeah!

168
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:42,421
- Yeah, let's do it.
- Okay, but just go a little bit easy on it.

169
00:11:42,591 --> 00:11:44,750
Pile in, everybody.
No time to wipe your feet.

170
00:11:44,927 --> 00:11:45,958
Come on.

171
00:11:49,348 --> 00:11:51,506
Okay, piglet, start squealing.

172
00:11:51,684 --> 00:11:54,900
Where'd you get the lemons
for this lemonade?

173
00:11:54,186 --> 00:11:56,143
This is Country Time Lemonade Mix.

174
00:11:56,313 --> 00:11:59,480
There's never been anything
close to a lemon in it. I swear.

175
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:02,355
Hey. Nobody hassles
my little brother.

176
00:12:02,528 --> 00:12:06,478
Hey. And no one manhandles
the bosom chum of Nelson Muntz.

177
00:12:06,657 --> 00:12:09,907
Spring forth, burly protector,
and save me.

178
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:15,368
Jeez.

179
00:12:15,541 --> 00:12:18,791
I never hang out with him, normally.

180
00:12:20,212 --> 00:12:23,795
Hark to the tale of Nelson
And the boy he loved so dear

181
00:12:24,508 --> 00:12:28,700
They remained the best of friends
For years and years and years

182
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:30,972
- What are they saying?
- I'm not sure.

183
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:34,141
- I thought you said you could read lips.
- I assumed I could.

184
00:12:34,351 --> 00:12:35,762
It's no use, Milhouse.

185
00:12:35,936 --> 00:12:38,937
If we're gonna find that lemon tree,
I've got to go undercover.

186
00:12:39,106 --> 00:12:42,605
- What I need is a new face.
- You leave that to the baron and me.

187
00:12:46,613 --> 00:12:48,986
Hello there, fellow Shelbyvillians.

188
00:12:49,199 --> 00:12:50,528
Wait a minute.

189
00:12:50,701 --> 00:12:54,117
If you're from Shelbyville, how come
we've never seen you at school?

190
00:12:54,288 --> 00:12:57,823
- I don't go to school.
- Okay, what's two plus two?

191
00:12:58,420 --> 00:12:59,868
- Five.
- Story checks out.

192
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:03,371
We just got word
there's Springfield kids in town.

193
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:06,377
Curse those handsome devils.

194
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:10,850
We're going up to the bluffs to paint
"Springfield sucks" in huge letters.

195
00:13:10,262 --> 00:13:14,940
That way, whenever they look into
Shelbyville, they'll realize that they suck.

196
00:13:14,266 --> 00:13:17,884
- Radical.
- Quit copying me.

197
00:13:18,103 --> 00:13:22,481
You know, I wish there was
a Springfield kid here right now.

198
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:25,570
I'd fill his mouth with stinkbugs.

199
00:13:25,277 --> 00:13:26,855
No, not in my mouth...

200
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:30,196
...is what the kid would say.
To the bluffs.

201
00:13:33,118 --> 00:13:35,692
Well, a friendly Springfield hello
there, neighbors.

202
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:39,370
You know, we think some kids of ours
may be missing in your town.

203
00:13:39,583 --> 00:13:40,911
Missing children?

204
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:43,706
Sounds like Springfield's
got a discipline problem.

205
00:13:43,921 --> 00:13:47,337
Maybe that's why we beat them
at football nearly half the time, huh?

206
00:13:49,635 --> 00:13:53,383
Quit stalling, kid.
Write "Springfield sucks" in giant letters.

207
00:14:02,398 --> 00:14:04,889
His can control is excellent.

208
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:09,361
Yes. And that wig makes him look
a lot like one of the Beatles.

209
00:14:11,407 --> 00:14:16,318
That's right, the stranger who walks
amongst you is me, Bart Simpson.

210
00:14:17,538 --> 00:14:19,365
You know, Bart Simpson.

211
00:14:20,791 --> 00:14:24,160
- From Springfield?
- He's from Springfield. Get him!

212
00:14:36,849 --> 00:14:39,600
I'll use these spray cans
as jetpacks and fly to safety.

213
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:41,933
So long, losers.

214
00:14:46,525 --> 00:14:48,601
You're dead.

215
00:14:48,777 --> 00:14:50,853
Hey, look.
Someone's attractive cousin.

216
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:53,734
- Where? Where?
- I don't see anybody.

217
00:14:59,163 --> 00:15:01,369
So he thinks he can
out-skateboard me, huh?

218
00:15:01,582 --> 00:15:04,417
Launch me, boys.

219
00:15:28,442 --> 00:15:32,226
Slow down, you sidewalk-surfing
cube-gleamers.

220
00:15:39,244 --> 00:15:40,904
"Wet cement."

221
00:15:46,585 --> 00:15:49,760
I could sure use
that flying motorcycle now.

222
00:15:49,254 --> 00:15:51,461
You had your chance.

223
00:16:02,601 --> 00:16:04,807
Safe at last.

224
00:16:10,984 --> 00:16:14,210
"Caution: Exit through door seven only.

225
00:16:14,196 --> 00:16:17,861
All other rooms contain
man-eating tigers."

226
00:16:20,119 --> 00:16:23,701
Roman numerals. They never even tried
to teach us that in school.

227
00:16:25,416 --> 00:16:27,989
Milhouse, what's seven
in Roman numerals?

228
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:32,374
I'll tell you, but you really should end
each transmission with the word "over."

229
00:16:32,548 --> 00:16:34,457
- Over.
- Correction:

230
00:16:34,633 --> 00:16:37,669
The only thing that's over
is that transmission.

231
00:16:37,886 --> 00:16:40,460
Is this the untimely end of Milhouse?

232
00:16:41,348 --> 00:16:45,346
- But Milhouse is my name.
- But I thought I was the only one.

233
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:47,761
A pain I know all too well.

234
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:53,210
So this is what it feels like
when doves cry.

235
00:16:53,235 --> 00:16:55,607
Milhouse. Milhouse.
Now what do I do?

236
00:16:57,310 --> 00:16:58,608
Wait. I got it.

237
00:16:58,824 --> 00:17:00,318
I got it.

238
00:17:00,492 --> 00:17:02,818
I don't got it. Okay, think, Bart.

239
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:05,658
Where have you seen
Roman numerals before?

240
00:17:05,831 --> 00:17:08,500
I know. Rocky V.
That was the fifth one.

241
00:17:08,709 --> 00:17:14,664
So Rocky V plus Rocky II
equals Rocky VII: Adrian's Revenge!

242
00:17:16,633 --> 00:17:18,507
Come back here.

243
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:24,388
It's no use.
I'm never gonna find that tree.

244
00:17:24,558 --> 00:17:29,765
This whole raid was as useless as that
yellow, lemon-shaped rock over there.

245
00:17:29,938 --> 00:17:31,267
Wait a minute.

246
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,598
There's a lemon behind that rock.

247
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:36,604
The tree!

248
00:17:47,581 --> 00:17:49,621
A car impound lot.

249
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:52,704
The impenetrable fortress of suburbia.

250
00:17:52,878 --> 00:17:56,329
- We'll never get the tree back now.
- Keep your voices down, boys.

251
00:17:56,507 --> 00:18:00,635
- We didn't get this far to get found out.
- Found them! You kids are in big trouble.

252
00:18:00,803 --> 00:18:04,600
- Running away from home like this.
- But they stole our lemon tree.

253
00:18:04,223 --> 00:18:06,714
I don't care what excuse you've got.

254
00:18:06,892 --> 00:18:09,597
Nothing's gonna stop me
in the middle of this speech.

255
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:11,513
You're gonna... Lemon tree?

256
00:18:12,982 --> 00:18:16,564
That tree's been in Springfield
since the time of our forefathers.

257
00:18:16,735 --> 00:18:20,187
Give it back,
or we'll bust in there and take it.

258
00:18:20,406 --> 00:18:22,149
Bust in here and take it?

259
00:18:22,324 --> 00:18:26,536
- You must stupider than you look.
- Stupider like a fox!

260
00:18:33,711 --> 00:18:35,860
I'm okay.

261
00:18:39,258 --> 00:18:42,175
Don't you get it, Springfield?
It's over. You lose.

262
00:18:42,344 --> 00:18:46,722
Now, if you'll excuse me,
all this talk has made me hungry.

263
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,899
This is the darkest day
in the history of Springfield.

264
00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:59,605
If anybody wants me,
I'll be in the shower.

265
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:03,230
There's got to be a way
to get that tree back.

266
00:19:03,198 --> 00:19:05,524
Hey, look. A hospital.

267
00:19:05,743 --> 00:19:07,201
Pull in there.

268
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:11,279
Oh, great. Now I'm upside down.

269
00:19:15,252 --> 00:19:19,360
Oh, dear, some thoughtless human being
has parked in a hospital zone.

270
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:41,232
No one in history
has ever done anything this clever.

271
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:46,281
I'll get the gate.

272
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:52,949
That's okay, son. I'll take care of him.

273
00:19:55,834 --> 00:19:59,380
Faster, son!
He's got a taste for meat now.

274
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:10,130
Get out here, son.
There's a-doings a-transpiring.

275
00:20:10,224 --> 00:20:13,590
Let's shut the gate and seal them in.

276
00:20:13,268 --> 00:20:15,344
Gun it, Flanders.

277
00:20:15,604 --> 00:20:19,139
It won't start.
Something's draining the battery.

278
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:21,401
Sorry.

279
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:28,484
We made it.

280
00:20:29,785 --> 00:20:31,576
Eat my shorts, Shelbyville.

281
00:20:31,787 --> 00:20:33,863
- Eat my shorts.
- Eat my shorts.

282
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:36,198
Yes, eat all of our shirts.

283
00:20:36,417 --> 00:20:38,705
Oh, you lousy Springfielders, you...

284
00:20:38,877 --> 00:20:41,166
Shake harder, boy.

285
00:20:42,881 --> 00:20:44,957
We did it!

286
00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:48,382
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

287
00:20:52,474 --> 00:20:57,635
And with that, a mighty cheer went up
from the heroes of Springfield.

288
00:20:57,855 --> 00:21:01,580
They had brought the sacred tree
back to its native soil.

289
00:21:01,233 --> 00:21:04,151
And though Flanders was stuck
with the impound fee...

290
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:07,320
...he could easily afford it.

291
00:21:07,531 --> 00:21:11,481
- More lemonade, Bart?
- Absolutely.

292
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,198
Say when.

293
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:17,201
There are over 14 parts
of the lemon that are...

294
00:21:17,374 --> 00:21:21,668
And with that, a mighty cheer went up
from the heroes of Shelbyville.

295
00:21:21,879 --> 00:21:24,796
They had banished
the awful lemon tree forever...

296
00:21:24,965 --> 00:21:26,839
...because it was haunted.

297
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:28,675
Now, let's all celebrate...

298
00:21:28,844 --> 00:21:32,593
...with a cool glass of turnip juice.

299
