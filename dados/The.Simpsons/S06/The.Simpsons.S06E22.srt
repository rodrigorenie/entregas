1
00:00:06,186 --> 00:00:07,846
Round Springfield

2
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,130
Hey, kids, it's story time!

3
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:31,144
I'm gonna tell you the story
of Krusty's expensive new suit:

4
00:01:31,355 --> 00:01:34,309
His sexual-harassment suit.

5
00:01:34,525 --> 00:01:36,102
Oh, boy.

6
00:01:36,318 --> 00:01:38,441
Anyway, as part of Krusty's
plea bargain...

7
00:01:38,612 --> 00:01:40,652
...he has a new
court-ordered sidekick...

8
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:42,987
...Ms. No-Means-No.

9
00:01:44,326 --> 00:01:47,161
You're hot. Let's get some dinner
after the show.

10
00:01:48,789 --> 00:01:52,750
I have dinner with all my employees.
Right, Sideshow Mel?

11
00:01:52,292 --> 00:01:54,840
We've never spoken outside of work.

12
00:01:57,589 --> 00:02:00,923
I'm surprised he didn't blame
his problems on his Percodan addiction.

13
00:02:01,135 --> 00:02:03,174
Wasn't my fault. It was the Percodan.

14
00:02:03,345 --> 00:02:06,500
If you ask me,
that stuff rots your brain.

15
00:02:06,223 --> 00:02:08,500
And now a word from my new sponsor.

16
00:02:08,225 --> 00:02:11,143
Percodan?! Oh, crap!

17
00:02:12,146 --> 00:02:14,304
Bart, are you ready
for your history test?

18
00:02:14,523 --> 00:02:16,148
You bet, Mom. Ask me anything.

19
00:02:16,358 --> 00:02:20,605
Okay. Who was
George Washington Carver?

20
00:02:20,946 --> 00:02:22,855
The guy who chopped up
George Washington?

21
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,490
Really?

22
00:02:37,379 --> 00:02:41,800
- Bart, you said you were going to study.
- My stomach.

23
00:02:41,258 --> 00:02:45,338
- You just don't wanna take that test.
- No, I mean it. It really hurts.

24
00:02:45,554 --> 00:02:47,179
Mom, I think he's serious.

25
00:02:47,681 --> 00:02:49,920
Kids are so naive.

26
00:02:49,266 --> 00:02:52,267
Lisa, when you get to be our age,
you'll learn a few things.

27
00:02:52,478 --> 00:02:54,885
Like when a sign says,
"Do not feed the bears"...

28
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,389
...man, you'd better not
feed the bears.

29
00:02:57,566 --> 00:02:59,523
Now, get to school, boy.

30
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:05,864
Mrs. Krabappel, I can't take the test.
I have a stomachache.

31
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:09,983
Well, that's a lame excuse
for an excuse.

32
00:03:10,204 --> 00:03:13,489
Look, if you ignore me and I die,
you'll get in a lot of trouble.

33
00:03:13,707 --> 00:03:16,163
Read page six of the school charter.

34
00:03:16,377 --> 00:03:20,326
"No teacher shall be held accountable
if Bart Simpson dies."

35
00:03:20,547 --> 00:03:23,548
We're also absolved if Milhouse
gets eaten by the school snake.

36
00:03:23,717 --> 00:03:27,585
Hey, cool, there's a rabbit in here.

37
00:03:28,722 --> 00:03:33,431
Mrs. Krabappel, I'm done failing the test.
Can I please go to the nurse?

38
00:03:33,644 --> 00:03:35,471
Gosh, maybe you really are in pain.

39
00:03:35,646 --> 00:03:39,311
Well, it would be cruel
not to let you go.

40
00:03:49,451 --> 00:03:50,483
Now you may go.

41
00:03:52,121 --> 00:03:54,742
Lunchlady Doris, why are you here?

42
00:03:54,957 --> 00:03:58,824
Budget cuts. They've even got
Groundskeeper Willie teaching French.

43
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:03,256
Bonjour, you cheese-eating
surrender monkeys.

44
00:04:03,465 --> 00:04:05,754
Look, my stomach really hurts.

45
00:04:05,968 --> 00:04:08,673
All I can give you are
these chewable Prozac for kids.

46
00:04:08,846 --> 00:04:13,424
Your choice: Manic-Depressive Mouse
or the Bluebird of Unhappiness.

47
00:04:14,977 --> 00:04:18,512
Superintendent Chalmers, meet
our new school nurse, Lunchlady Doris.

48
00:04:18,689 --> 00:04:22,687
Nice to see you. Seymour, why is that
student lying unconscious on the floor?

49
00:04:22,901 --> 00:04:25,274
Well, in many cases,
the floor is the best...

50
00:04:25,446 --> 00:04:27,853
Oh, look, here comes Lumpy,
the school snake.

51
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,108
Help! Help!

52
00:04:30,326 --> 00:04:32,402
Oh, Lord.

53
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:41,701
Don't worry, son. You'll be fine.

54
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:44,714
This boy's appendix is inflamed
and about to burst...

55
00:04:44,882 --> 00:04:48,796
...which will make it easier to find
once I get in there.

56
00:04:50,763 --> 00:04:54,511
Man, these are primo seats.
I could really go for a hot dog.

57
00:04:54,683 --> 00:04:56,806
Homer, this is an operation.

58
00:04:56,977 --> 00:05:00,311
Hot dogs! Get your hot dogs here!

59
00:05:00,522 --> 00:05:05,101
Okay, Bart, I will count to three,
and you will be sound asleep.

60
00:05:05,277 --> 00:05:07,947
One, two, three.

61
00:05:08,113 --> 00:05:10,735
- Out like a light.
- Scalpel.

62
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:16,364
Maybe if I fiddle with these knobs.

63
00:05:17,289 --> 00:05:19,163
Hey, I smell gas.

64
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:21,242
Pleasant gas.

65
00:05:21,418 --> 00:05:24,253
Night-night gas.

66
00:05:26,882 --> 00:05:29,171
How's my special little guy?

67
00:05:29,343 --> 00:05:31,798
How you feeling, big brother?

68
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:34,888
Oh, this is wonderful. You're alive.

69
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:38,930
- No thanks to you, Homer.
- Why, you little...

70
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:44,813
Now, Homer, please. The boy's
just had a very serious operation.

71
00:05:44,984 --> 00:05:46,980
Oh, right.

72
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:51,446
Now, Bart, I found the culprit:
A jagged, metal cereal O.

73
00:05:51,657 --> 00:05:54,409
Wicked. I got this cool scar.

74
00:05:54,618 --> 00:05:56,278
And I get to miss a week of school.

75
00:05:57,705 --> 00:06:00,112
Dr. Hibbert, can I have
my appendix out?

76
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:05,960
Why not. Follow me, kids.

77
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:08,621
Nurse, prep these children.

78
00:06:09,883 --> 00:06:12,719
I'm glad you're okay, Bart.

79
00:06:22,604 --> 00:06:24,147
Bleeding Gums Murphy.

80
00:06:24,356 --> 00:06:27,559
Little Lisa. It's good to see you again.

81
00:06:27,776 --> 00:06:29,816
It's been a long time.

82
00:06:31,739 --> 00:06:33,862
My friends call me Bleeding Gums.

83
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:35,866
How'd you get a name like that?

84
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:39,196
Let me put it this way.
You ever been to the dentist?

85
00:06:39,371 --> 00:06:40,450
- Yeah.
- Not me.

86
00:06:40,664 --> 00:06:45,659
I suppose I should go to one, but I
got enough pain in my life as it is.

87
00:06:46,462 --> 00:06:49,581
- What are you here for?
- My brother just had his appendix out.

88
00:06:49,798 --> 00:06:52,835
- Is he gonna be okay?
- Hello, I'm Dr. Cheeks.

89
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,548
I'm doing my rounds,
and I'm a little behind.

90
00:06:55,971 --> 00:06:57,798
He'll be fine.

91
00:06:59,975 --> 00:07:04,684
Lisa, I sure am glad you dropped by.
You're the first visitor I've had.

92
00:07:04,897 --> 00:07:07,566
- What about your family?
- I don't really have a family.

93
00:07:07,733 --> 00:07:10,936
All I had was a little brother
who grew up to become a doctor.

94
00:07:11,111 --> 00:07:14,943
He used to laugh
at the most inappropriate times.

95
00:07:15,282 --> 00:07:17,654
I've got an older brother
that I'll never see.

96
00:07:17,826 --> 00:07:21,409
He's a jazz musician or some such.
Oh, well. Bye-bye.

97
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:24,332
It must be awful to be
all alone in the world.

98
00:07:24,541 --> 00:07:26,415
Well, I always had my music.

99
00:07:26,585 --> 00:07:30,203
I learned at the feet
of Blind Willy Witherspoon.

100
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:35,339
I've been playing jazz for 30 years,
and I just can't make a go of it.

101
00:07:35,511 --> 00:07:37,503
I want you to have my saxophone.

102
00:07:37,721 --> 00:07:40,508
This isn't a saxophone,
it's an umbrella.

103
00:07:40,724 --> 00:07:42,764
So I've played a umbrella
for 30 years?

104
00:07:42,935 --> 00:07:44,346
Why didn't anybody tell me?

105
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:48,680
- We all thought it was funny.
- That's not funny.

106
00:07:48,857 --> 00:07:53,400
Then I got my big break.
I was on Steve Allen's Tonight! Show.

107
00:07:55,114 --> 00:08:00,274
Now, a brilliant jazz musician who's
inspired me to do some improv poetry.

108
00:08:00,452 --> 00:08:03,619
Twinkle, twinkle, groovy cat
How I wonder where you at

109
00:08:03,789 --> 00:08:06,743
I really love the way you cook
Like me, when I wrote this book

110
00:08:06,917 --> 00:08:08,328
How to Make Love to Steve Allen.

111
00:08:08,544 --> 00:08:11,820
From the author of
Happiness Is a Naked Steve Allen...

112
00:08:11,255 --> 00:08:16,830
...Journey to the Center of Steve Allen
and The Joy of Cooking Steve Allen.

113
00:08:16,301 --> 00:08:19,671
I cut my first and only album,
Sax on the Beach.

114
00:08:19,888 --> 00:08:24,883
But then I spent all my money
on my $ 1500-a-day habit.

115
00:08:25,769 --> 00:08:28,439
I'd like another Fabergé egg, please.

116
00:08:28,605 --> 00:08:32,603
- Sir, don't you think you've had enough?
- I'll tell you when I've had enough!

117
00:08:34,737 --> 00:08:36,646
When was the last time you worked?

118
00:08:36,864 --> 00:08:40,778
In '86, when I did a guest shot
on The Cosby Show.

119
00:08:41,785 --> 00:08:45,285
Hey, kids. Meet Grandpa Murphy.

120
00:08:45,497 --> 00:08:47,786
But we have three grandpas already.

121
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:50,289
This one is a great jazz musician.

122
00:08:50,502 --> 00:08:52,127
They all are.

123
00:08:52,963 --> 00:08:56,628
You see, the kids,
they listen to the rap music...

124
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,959
...which gives them the brain damage.

125
00:08:59,136 --> 00:09:03,383
With their hipping and the hopping
and the bipping and the bopping.

126
00:09:03,557 --> 00:09:07,471
So they don't know
what the jazz is all about.

127
00:09:07,686 --> 00:09:10,806
You see, jazz is like
a Jell-O Pudding Pop.

128
00:09:10,981 --> 00:09:13,899
No. Actually, it's more like Kodak film.

129
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:17,437
No. Actually, jazz is like
the New Coke.

130
00:09:17,613 --> 00:09:20,186
It'll be around forever.

131
00:09:22,701 --> 00:09:24,658
Wow, you've had some career.

132
00:09:24,828 --> 00:09:28,660
Although the moral seems to be that
a life of jazz leaves you sad and lonely.

133
00:09:28,832 --> 00:09:33,245
Well, before you came to visit,
I would have agreed with you.

134
00:09:35,547 --> 00:09:39,470
This just in: Krusty the Clown staged
a press conference today...

135
00:09:39,218 --> 00:09:42,551
...to defend himself against charges
that his products are unsafe...

136
00:09:42,721 --> 00:09:44,465
...his theme park is a deathtrap...

137
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,934
...and that he's marketing videos
of Tonya Harding's wedding night.

138
00:09:49,144 --> 00:09:51,137
I contend the tourists
were decapitated...

139
00:09:51,313 --> 00:09:55,620
...before they entered the Krustyland
House of Knives. Next question.

140
00:09:55,234 --> 00:10:00,524
What about that little boy who got
appendicitis from eating your cereal?

141
00:10:00,739 --> 00:10:05,485
To prove that this metal O is harmless,
I will personally eat one.

142
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,408
See? There's nothing...

143
00:10:10,791 --> 00:10:15,120
Oh, boy!
This thing is shredding my insides!

144
00:10:15,296 --> 00:10:19,210
Krusty, that wasn 't the metal one.
That was a regular Krusty-O.

145
00:10:19,383 --> 00:10:20,925
It's poison.

146
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:26,200
- So you all set for your recital?
- I sure am. Look.

147
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,677
I stopped brushing my teeth
so I can play just like you.

148
00:10:30,394 --> 00:10:34,937
Lisa, honey, music comes from what's
in your heart, not what's on your teeth.

149
00:10:35,107 --> 00:10:36,850
Come on, let's jam.

150
00:11:31,997 --> 00:11:35,117
Hey, Moe, what will you give me
for an A.A. Chip?

151
00:11:35,334 --> 00:11:39,414
Barney, this is a five-minute chip.
It's worth a Pabst.

152
00:11:43,133 --> 00:11:46,834
Baby, you are gonna
knock them dead.

153
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:50,637
Here, take this for luck.

154
00:11:51,225 --> 00:11:54,724
Your sax! Thank you so much.

155
00:12:00,984 --> 00:12:03,310
Now, I have learned that
most of the orchestra...

156
00:12:03,487 --> 00:12:05,314
...is having their appendixes removed.

157
00:12:05,489 --> 00:12:08,620
So without further ado,
I give you the remnants...

158
00:12:08,242 --> 00:12:11,770
...of the Springfield Elementary School
orchestra.

159
00:12:11,286 --> 00:12:15,201
On saxophone, Lisa Simpson.
On triangle, Martin Prince.

160
00:12:15,374 --> 00:12:19,502
And with a flute up his nose,
Ralph Wiggum.

161
00:12:20,296 --> 00:12:21,494
That's some nice fluting.

162
00:12:21,714 --> 00:12:23,671
They'll play
"Stars and Stripes Forever."

163
00:12:23,841 --> 00:12:25,917
Hopefully not forever.

164
00:12:31,307 --> 00:12:33,180
This sucks.

165
00:12:45,154 --> 00:12:49,365
Hey, Bleeding Gums, I was great!
And I owe it all to...

166
00:12:49,575 --> 00:12:51,340
What happened to Mr. Murphy?

167
00:12:51,243 --> 00:12:53,340
I'm sorry. He passed away.

168
00:13:06,383 --> 00:13:08,755
Lisa, honey, are you gonna be okay?

169
00:13:09,261 --> 00:13:13,930
Bleeding Gums was my hero,
and I never got to tell him how I felt.

170
00:13:13,307 --> 00:13:14,552
Oh, I'm sure he knew.

171
00:13:14,725 --> 00:13:17,560
And I'm sure that wherever he is now,
he's happy.

172
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:22,266
But he was the only person who had
the same love for music that I do.

173
00:13:23,859 --> 00:13:25,318
Thank you.

174
00:13:25,486 --> 00:13:28,190
Oh, Dad, why did he have to die?

175
00:13:28,405 --> 00:13:32,652
Well, it's like the time that your cat,
Snowball, got run over.

176
00:13:32,826 --> 00:13:34,369
- Remember, honey?
- Yeah.

177
00:13:34,578 --> 00:13:37,690
What I'm saying is,
all we have to do...

178
00:13:37,247 --> 00:13:40,165
...is go down to the pound
and get a new jazzman.

179
00:13:40,334 --> 00:13:43,390
Oh, Dad!

180
00:13:46,256 --> 00:13:47,799
I blew it again.

181
00:13:47,966 --> 00:13:49,377
What?

182
00:13:52,388 --> 00:13:54,546
Hey, Lis, you still upset
about that jazz guy?

183
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:58,580
If it helps,
I believe that after you die...

184
00:13:58,227 --> 00:14:00,599
...you can come back
as whatever you want.

185
00:14:00,771 --> 00:14:02,728
- I'll be a butterfly.
- How come?

186
00:14:02,898 --> 00:14:08,521
Because nobody ever
suspects the butterfly.

187
00:14:10,239 --> 00:14:11,816
I didn't burn down the school.

188
00:14:11,991 --> 00:14:15,270
It was the butterfly, I tell you.
The butterfly!

189
00:14:15,244 --> 00:14:17,367
He's crazy, boys. Get the Taser.

190
00:14:23,961 --> 00:14:27,793
Maybe I need to talk to somebody
with a little more age and wisdom.

191
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:30,794
Death stalks you at every turn.

192
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:33,631
- Grampa.
- Well, it does.

193
00:14:34,596 --> 00:14:36,423
There it is. Death!

194
00:14:36,598 --> 00:14:37,927
It's only Maggie.

195
00:14:38,767 --> 00:14:40,960
Oh, yeah.

196
00:14:40,269 --> 00:14:44,931
You know, at my age,
the mind starts playing tricks. So...

197
00:14:45,107 --> 00:14:47,479
- Death!
- That's only the cat.

198
00:14:48,485 --> 00:14:51,570
- Death!
- That's Maggie again, Grampa.

199
00:14:52,197 --> 00:14:54,985
Where were we? Death!

200
00:14:56,702 --> 00:14:59,240
How come it won't stop hurting?

201
00:14:59,788 --> 00:15:02,458
Lisa, it's normal to be sad
when a friend dies.

202
00:15:02,625 --> 00:15:04,701
And Bleeding Gums
was a good friend to you.

203
00:15:04,877 --> 00:15:08,246
But nobody is really gone
as long as we remember them.

204
00:15:08,464 --> 00:15:10,706
If you really want to preserve
his memory...

205
00:15:10,883 --> 00:15:15,675
...I recommend getting a tattoo.
It preserves the things you love.

206
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:19,347
"Starland Vocal Band"? They suck!

207
00:15:19,767 --> 00:15:21,427
Death!

208
00:15:29,193 --> 00:15:33,440
- Isn't anybody gonna show up?
- Well, Lisa, we've waited an hour.

209
00:15:34,156 --> 00:15:37,691
Dearly beloved,
we are gathered here today...

210
00:15:37,868 --> 00:15:40,655
...to bid farewell
to Blood and Guts Murphy...

211
00:15:40,829 --> 00:15:43,783
No! It was Bleeding Gums Murphy.

212
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:47,658
Anyway, Bloody Gums Murphy
was quite the sousaphone player...

213
00:15:47,836 --> 00:15:51,122
Saxophone! He was a jazz musician.

214
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:53,463
You didn't know him.
Nobody knew him.

215
00:15:53,675 --> 00:15:55,860
But he was a great man.

216
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:57,965
And I won't rest
until all of Springfield...

217
00:15:58,138 --> 00:16:00,843
...knows the name
Bleeding Gums Murphy.

218
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,590
And I won't rest
until I've gotten a hot dog.

219
00:16:03,769 --> 00:16:05,263
Homer, this is a cemetery.

220
00:16:05,437 --> 00:16:09,305
Hot dogs! Get your hot dogs here!

221
00:16:09,483 --> 00:16:11,855
What do you do,
follow my husband around?

222
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:15,396
Lady, he's putting my kids
through college.

223
00:16:19,952 --> 00:16:22,525
Good news, Bart.
The Krusty-O Cereal Corp...

224
00:16:22,705 --> 00:16:27,248
...has settled your case for $ 100,000,
less, of course, my legal fees.

225
00:16:27,459 --> 00:16:28,918
What kind of legal fees?

226
00:16:29,128 --> 00:16:30,752
Well, for a case this complex...

227
00:16:30,921 --> 00:16:33,495
...I had to assemble
a crack team of lawyers.

228
00:16:33,674 --> 00:16:35,713
Ronald Chaporo, trial attorney.

229
00:16:35,884 --> 00:16:39,419
Albert Dershman, who can hold
three billiard balls in his mouth.

230
00:16:39,638 --> 00:16:42,460
How much of the 100 thou do I get?

231
00:16:43,517 --> 00:16:45,344
Five hundred dollars?

232
00:16:45,561 --> 00:16:47,434
- Yes, well...
- Cool.

233
00:16:47,646 --> 00:16:50,647
Glad you're happy. Let's roll.

234
00:16:53,402 --> 00:16:55,975
I can't believe it. Five hundred bucks!

235
00:16:56,155 --> 00:16:59,571
Just think what I can do
with that money.

236
00:17:00,909 --> 00:17:03,661
Five hundred dollars on red.

237
00:17:04,872 --> 00:17:07,279
The winner is black.

238
00:17:08,292 --> 00:17:09,371
Cool.

239
00:17:09,585 --> 00:17:13,285
I wanna honor Bleeding Gums' memory,
but I don't know where to start.

240
00:17:13,505 --> 00:17:17,420
Maybe you could get the local
jazz station to do a tribute to him, huh?

241
00:17:17,593 --> 00:17:21,804
Jazz. They just make it up
as they go along. I could do that.

242
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:27,138
- That's "Mary Had a Little Lamb."
- Okay, then this:

243
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:33,231
That's the same thing.
You just replaced "dees" with "do's."

244
00:17:34,651 --> 00:17:38,210
I have a request. I'd like you to do
a tribute to Bleeding Gums Murphy.

245
00:17:38,197 --> 00:17:40,948
I'd love to, little sister,
but we don't have his album.

246
00:17:41,158 --> 00:17:43,234
- What if I could find it?
- I'd spin it.

247
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:45,700
But ain't no one gonna hear it.

248
00:17:45,245 --> 00:17:47,119
Our broadcast range is only 23 feet...

249
00:17:47,289 --> 00:17:50,907
...which makes us the most powerful
jazz station in the entire U.S. Of A.

250
00:17:51,126 --> 00:17:53,000
Gee, your station has
a lot of problems.

251
00:17:53,212 --> 00:17:55,667
Tell me about it.
Just look at our morning guy.

252
00:17:55,881 --> 00:18:01,880
Hello. This is "Moleman in the Morning."
Good Moleman to you.

253
00:18:01,261 --> 00:18:04,465
Today, part four of our series
of the agonizing pain...

254
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,676
...in which I live every day.

255
00:18:10,104 --> 00:18:12,511
Two hundred and fifty dollars?

256
00:18:12,731 --> 00:18:16,100
But I need that album to honor
the memory of Bleeding Gums Murphy.

257
00:18:16,318 --> 00:18:18,774
He's dead?
Well, why didn't you say so?

258
00:18:24,702 --> 00:18:27,270
Where am I gonna get $500?

259
00:18:36,714 --> 00:18:39,390
Now drive, Smithers. Drive.

260
00:18:45,598 --> 00:18:47,970
Excuse me, my good man,
I have $500 to blow.

261
00:18:48,142 --> 00:18:51,760
- What have you got?
- Behold the ultimate Pog.

262
00:18:53,605 --> 00:18:55,479
I'll take it.

263
00:19:07,703 --> 00:19:11,748
Lisa, look what I've got. Ta-da!

264
00:19:12,374 --> 00:19:15,660
Bart, I can't believe it. But why?

265
00:19:15,836 --> 00:19:19,390
When I said my stomach hurt,
you were the only one who believed me.

266
00:19:19,214 --> 00:19:22,548
Oh, thank you. But $500...

267
00:19:22,718 --> 00:19:25,430
You'll never see that much
money again.

268
00:19:25,262 --> 00:19:27,385
Oh, yeah? Take a look at this.

269
00:19:31,185 --> 00:19:33,640
I got the album.

270
00:19:34,688 --> 00:19:37,358
Here. You can listen to it on this.

271
00:19:40,611 --> 00:19:43,695
I did the best I could, Bleeding Gums.

272
00:20:06,345 --> 00:20:09,346
Attention, all units.
Attention, all units.

273
00:20:09,515 --> 00:20:12,219
Poison-gas cloud heading for...

274
00:20:14,812 --> 00:20:18,430
That's nice. Hey, it's getting cloudy.

275
00:20:19,817 --> 00:20:21,228
Oh, boy.

276
00:20:32,454 --> 00:20:35,206
That was for you, Bleeding Gums.

277
00:20:36,792 --> 00:20:40,125
You've made
an old jazzman happy, Lisa.

278
00:20:40,296 --> 00:20:44,708
You must avenge my death, Kimba.
I mean, Simba.

279
00:20:44,883 --> 00:20:47,900
Luke, I am your father.

280
00:20:47,261 --> 00:20:49,520
This is CNN.

281
00:20:49,221 --> 00:20:53,500
Will you guys pipe down?
I'm saying goodbye to Lisa.

282
00:20:53,183 --> 00:20:55,223
We're sorry.

283
00:20:55,436 --> 00:20:57,309
I don't want you to go.

284
00:20:57,521 --> 00:21:00,226
Sorry, but I have to. Goodbye.

285
00:21:01,483 --> 00:21:03,393
Goodbye.

286
00:21:07,573 --> 00:21:10,408
Oh, what the heck.
Once more, from the top.

287
00:22:19,728 --> 00:22:21,306
One more time!

288
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,354
Oh, come on, Lisa.

289
00:22:23,524 --> 00:22:26,150
I got a date with Billie Holiday.

290
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:32,106
