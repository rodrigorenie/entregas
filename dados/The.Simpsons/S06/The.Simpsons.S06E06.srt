1
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:04,850
Hello, once again.

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:10,434
As usual, I must warn you all that this
year's Halloween show is very scary...

3
00:00:10,649 --> 00:00:14,777
...and those of you with young children
may want to send them off to bed and...

4
00:00:14,945 --> 00:00:20,485
Oh, my. It seems the show is so scary,
Congress won't even let us show it.

5
00:00:20,659 --> 00:00:24,360
Instead they've suggested the 1947
classic Glenn Ford movie...

6
00:00:24,538 --> 00:00:26,329
...Two Hundred Miles to Oregon.

7
00:00:32,421 --> 00:00:34,829
There's nothing wrong
with your television set.

8
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,332
Do not attempt to adjust your picture.

9
00:00:37,551 --> 00:00:39,591
We are controlling the transmission.

10
00:00:39,762 --> 00:00:41,505
What's that, boy? We're in control?

11
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,218
Hey, look! I can see my voice!

12
00:00:49,897 --> 00:00:55,104
This is my voice on TV

13
00:00:55,277 --> 00:00:57,851
- Dad, you're ruining the mood!
- Sorry.

14
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:01,862
For the next half-hour,
we will control what you see and hear.

15
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:06,411
You are about to experience
the terror and foul horror of...

16
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:09,581
...The Simpsons Halloween Special.

17
00:02:02,261 --> 00:02:05,961
Well, it was a long trip,
but we're almost there.

18
00:02:06,181 --> 00:02:09,266
Homer, did you remember to lock
the front door of the house?

19
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:15,850
Well, it's been two long trips,
but we're finally almost there again.

20
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:19,559
When you locked the front door,
did you remember to lock the back door?

21
00:02:23,657 --> 00:02:27,702
Oh, no! We left Grampa
back at the gas station!

22
00:02:29,121 --> 00:02:31,244
What about Grampa?

23
00:02:35,628 --> 00:02:36,956
- Hello!
- Hi!

24
00:02:37,129 --> 00:02:38,754
- We're here!
- Oh, goody.

25
00:02:38,922 --> 00:02:40,796
The sea monkeys I ordered
have arrived.

26
00:02:41,508 --> 00:02:43,382
Look at them cavort and caper.

27
00:02:43,594 --> 00:02:46,595
Sir, they're the new
winter caretakers for the lodge.

28
00:02:46,764 --> 00:02:50,970
Yes, they work hard
and they play hard.

29
00:02:50,309 --> 00:02:53,263
This house has quite a long
and colorful history.

30
00:02:53,437 --> 00:02:56,224
It was built on an ancient
Indian burial ground...

31
00:02:56,398 --> 00:03:00,147
...and was the setting of Satanic rituals,
witch burnings...

32
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:03,154
...and five John Denver
Christmas specials.

33
00:03:04,114 --> 00:03:05,822
John Denver.

34
00:03:11,914 --> 00:03:15,746
That's odd. Usually the blood
gets off at the second floor.

35
00:03:22,257 --> 00:03:24,831
Hey, I found a shortcut
through your hedge maze.

36
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:26,339
Why, you little...

37
00:03:26,512 --> 00:03:28,385
No, no. Go easy on the wee one.

38
00:03:28,555 --> 00:03:31,971
His father's gonna go crazy
and chop them all into haggis.

39
00:03:32,142 --> 00:03:33,423
What's haggis?

40
00:03:33,602 --> 00:03:37,101
Boy, you read my thoughts!
You've got the shinning.

41
00:03:37,314 --> 00:03:40,232
- You mean shining.
- You want to get sued?

42
00:03:40,401 --> 00:03:43,402
Now, look, boy,
if your da goes gaga...

43
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:49,360
...you just use that shin of yours
to call me and I'll come a-running.

44
00:03:49,535 --> 00:03:52,655
But don't be reading my mind
between 4 and 5.

45
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:54,158
That's Willie's time!

46
00:03:57,584 --> 00:04:01,368
Yes, by cutting off cable TV
and the beer supply...

47
00:04:01,547 --> 00:04:04,501
...I can ensure an honest winter's work
out of those lowlifes.

48
00:04:04,675 --> 00:04:07,711
Sir, did you ever stop to think
that maybe it was doing this...

49
00:04:07,886 --> 00:04:11,718
...that caused the previous caretakers
to go insane and murder their families?

50
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:15,940
Perhaps. Tell you what, we come back
and everyone's slaughtered...

51
00:04:15,269 --> 00:04:16,644
...I owe you a Coke.

52
00:04:24,278 --> 00:04:27,113
Cable's out. Think I'll have a beer.

53
00:04:28,365 --> 00:04:30,737
Not a drop in the house.
What do you know.

54
00:04:30,909 --> 00:04:33,745
Homer, I'm impressed.
You're taking this quite well.

55
00:04:33,954 --> 00:04:35,746
I'll kill you! I'll kill all of you!

56
00:04:35,956 --> 00:04:39,400
- Homer!
- Sorry. Sorry. Don't worry.

57
00:04:39,209 --> 00:04:41,700
There's plenty I can do
to keep myself occupied.

58
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:44,168
Maybe I'll check out
that ax collection.

59
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:46,131
See you later.

60
00:04:46,342 --> 00:04:48,490
Mom, is Dad gonna kill us?

61
00:04:48,218 --> 00:04:50,258
We're just gonna have to
wait and see.

62
00:04:54,642 --> 00:04:56,930
- So, what'll it be, Homer?
- Moe, give me a beer!

63
00:04:57,102 --> 00:04:59,120
No. Not unless you kill your family.

64
00:04:59,188 --> 00:05:01,264
Why should I kill my family?

65
00:05:01,482 --> 00:05:03,106
They'd be much happier as ghosts.

66
00:05:03,275 --> 00:05:06,609
- You don't look so happy.
- Oh, I'm happy. I'm very happy.

67
00:05:07,196 --> 00:05:09,521
See? Now waste your family,
I'll give you a beer.

68
00:05:10,532 --> 00:05:13,652
Homer? Homie?

69
00:05:14,161 --> 00:05:16,996
What he's typed will be a window
into his madness.

70
00:05:21,877 --> 00:05:23,502
"Feeling fine."

71
00:05:23,712 --> 00:05:25,539
Wow, that's a relief.

72
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:39,762
This is less encouraging.

73
00:05:42,815 --> 00:05:44,973
Well, what do you think, Marge?

74
00:05:45,234 --> 00:05:47,392
All I need is a title.

75
00:05:47,569 --> 00:05:49,479
I was thinking along the lines of...

76
00:05:49,655 --> 00:05:54,281
...No TV and No Beer Make Homer
something, something.

77
00:05:54,493 --> 00:05:55,904
Go Crazy?

78
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,445
Don't mind if I do!

79
00:06:07,715 --> 00:06:09,292
Stay away from me, Homer!

80
00:06:09,466 --> 00:06:11,922
Give me the bat, Marge!
Give me the bat!

81
00:06:12,136 --> 00:06:14,342
Give me the bat! Come on.
Give me the bat.

82
00:06:14,513 --> 00:06:16,304
Give me the bat...

83
00:06:17,766 --> 00:06:19,593
Scaredy cat.

84
00:06:25,774 --> 00:06:28,526
You stay here till
you're no longer insane.

85
00:06:28,694 --> 00:06:30,733
Chili would be good tonight.

86
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:36,720
Homer, it's Moe.

87
00:06:36,243 --> 00:06:38,948
Look, some of the ghouls and I
are a little concerned...

88
00:06:39,121 --> 00:06:42,288
...the project isn't moving forward.
- Can't murder now. Eating.

89
00:06:42,458 --> 00:06:46,123
- For crying out loud. Come on.
- No!

90
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:53,507
Here's Johnny!

91
00:06:55,179 --> 00:06:58,345
David Letterman!

92
00:06:58,515 --> 00:07:01,351
Hi, David. I'm Grampa.

93
00:07:02,144 --> 00:07:05,150
I'm Mike Wallace. I'm Morley Safer.
And I'm Ed Bradley.

94
00:07:05,189 --> 00:07:07,858
All this and Andy Rooney
tonight on 60 Minutes!

95
00:07:12,112 --> 00:07:14,690
Hello, police, this is Marge Simpson.

96
00:07:14,281 --> 00:07:16,902
My husband is on
a murderous rampage. Over.

97
00:07:17,117 --> 00:07:20,700
Well, thank God that's over.
I was worried there for a second.

98
00:07:20,913 --> 00:07:22,656
- No answer.
- Don't worry, Mom.

99
00:07:22,831 --> 00:07:26,781
I can use my shinning to call Willie.

100
00:07:29,296 --> 00:07:32,100
And that was the first time
she'd ever flown a plane.

101
00:07:32,966 --> 00:07:35,292
The little fat boy and his family
are in trouble.

102
00:07:35,761 --> 00:07:38,299
I'm coming to rescue the lot of you!

103
00:07:39,306 --> 00:07:43,900
All right, loony,
show me what you got.

104
00:07:43,268 --> 00:07:46,560
Is that the best you can do?

105
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:49,314
Oh, my. I hope that rug
was Scotchgarded.

106
00:07:50,442 --> 00:07:53,313
Must kill family.

107
00:08:07,293 --> 00:08:09,962
- Had been given rifles,
but no ammunition.

108
00:08:10,254 --> 00:08:12,792
- Fortunately, there was a hardware store.
- Dad, look!

109
00:08:12,965 --> 00:08:16,168
Television! Teacher!
Mother! Secret lover.

110
00:08:16,468 --> 00:08:19,420
Urge to kill fading.

111
00:08:19,221 --> 00:08:21,794
Fading. Fading.

112
00:08:21,974 --> 00:08:24,263
Rising! Fading.

113
00:08:24,476 --> 00:08:27,394
Fading. Gone.

114
00:08:30,482 --> 00:08:33,483
Come, family.
Sit in the snow with Daddy...

115
00:08:33,652 --> 00:08:39,572
...and let us all bask in television's
warm, glowing, warming glow.

116
00:08:41,702 --> 00:08:44,489
Live from Broadway,
it's The Tony Awards.

117
00:08:44,663 --> 00:08:47,866
With your hosts,
Tyne Daly and Hal Linden.

118
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:51,457
- Homer, change channel.
- Can't. Frozen.

119
00:08:54,965 --> 00:08:58,299
Urge to kill rising.

120
00:09:03,849 --> 00:09:06,550
You know, Marge,
I've had my share of troubles.

121
00:09:06,226 --> 00:09:08,349
But sitting here now
with you and the kids...

122
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:11,355
...in our cozy home in this beautiful,
free country...

123
00:09:11,523 --> 00:09:15,473
...it just makes me feel
that I'm really a lucky guy.

124
00:09:15,694 --> 00:09:18,648
Dad, your hand is jammed
in the toaster!

125
00:09:18,906 --> 00:09:20,365
What?

126
00:09:23,243 --> 00:09:27,288
Get it off! Get it off!
Get it off of me!

127
00:09:31,377 --> 00:09:33,850
Dad, it's in there again!

128
00:09:33,796 --> 00:09:36,417
No! It's stuck on my hand.

129
00:09:39,843 --> 00:09:44,173
This shouldn't be too hard to fix,
with the right tools.

130
00:09:49,603 --> 00:09:51,975
There. Better than new.

131
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:56,269
Now, to take her for a test toast.

132
00:09:58,404 --> 00:09:59,779
What the...?

133
00:10:06,161 --> 00:10:07,572
Look at that.

134
00:10:07,746 --> 00:10:11,826
I'm the first non-Brazilian person
to travel backwards through time.

135
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,792
Correction, Homer. You're the second.

136
00:10:13,961 --> 00:10:16,333
- That's right, Mr. Peabody.
- Quiet, you.

137
00:10:22,302 --> 00:10:28,920
I've gone back to the time when
dinosaurs weren't just confined to zoos.

138
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:30,428
Okay, don't panic.

139
00:10:30,602 --> 00:10:33,853
Remember the advice your father
gave you on your wedding day.

140
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:37,890
If you ever travel back in time,
don't step on anything.

141
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,440
Because even the tiniest change...

142
00:10:40,612 --> 00:10:44,640
...can alter the future
in ways you can't imagine.

143
00:10:44,241 --> 00:10:48,191
Fine. As long as I stand perfectly still
and don't touch anything...

144
00:10:48,412 --> 00:10:51,164
...I won't destroy the future.

145
00:10:51,582 --> 00:10:54,333
Stupid bug! You go squish now!

146
00:10:55,544 --> 00:10:58,117
That was just one little
insignificant mosquito.

147
00:10:58,297 --> 00:11:00,455
That can't change the future, right?

148
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,632
Right?

149
00:11:09,266 --> 00:11:10,844
I'm back.

150
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:18,930
My loving family. Nothing's changed.

151
00:11:22,488 --> 00:11:24,611
Hidilly-ho, slave-a-reenos.

152
00:11:24,823 --> 00:11:26,567
Okilly-dokilly.

153
00:11:26,784 --> 00:11:30,912
Hey, what the hell is that geek
Flanders doing on TV?

154
00:11:31,789 --> 00:11:35,917
I see by the big board we got
a Negative Nelly in sector two.

155
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:38,955
I'm gonna have to ask
the whole family to kind of freeze...

156
00:11:39,129 --> 00:11:40,921
...and prepare for re-Neducation.

157
00:11:41,256 --> 00:11:42,501
Don't you remember, Dad?

158
00:11:42,675 --> 00:11:45,462
Flanders is the unquestioned
lord and master of the world.

159
00:11:57,815 --> 00:12:01,433
Okay, everybody.
Let's see some big smiles.

160
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:07,236
Just relax.
Let the hooks do their work.

161
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:09,942
What the hell are you smiling at?

162
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:13,861
Now, in case all that smiling
didn't cheer you up...

163
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:16,320
...there's one thing that never fails:

164
00:12:16,208 --> 00:12:19,791
A nice glass of warm milk, a little nap,
and a total frontal lobotomy.

165
00:12:20,212 --> 00:12:21,956
It's not so bad, Homer.

166
00:12:22,172 --> 00:12:25,800
They go in through your nose...

167
00:12:25,175 --> 00:12:28,212
...and they let you keep
the piece of brain they cut out.

168
00:12:28,387 --> 00:12:30,712
Look. Hello.

169
00:12:30,889 --> 00:12:34,804
Hello there. Who's that big man there?
Who's that?

170
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:37,640
- Join us, Father.
- Join us, Father.

171
00:12:37,855 --> 00:12:41,188
It's bliss.

172
00:12:42,484 --> 00:12:43,682
No!

173
00:12:49,783 --> 00:12:53,330
Oh, no. They're gaining on me.
Wait! I have an idea!

174
00:12:53,203 --> 00:12:56,952
These wieners will give me
the quick energy I need to escape!

175
00:13:00,669 --> 00:13:03,421
I gotta go back, fix future.

176
00:13:07,468 --> 00:13:09,756
This time I'm not gonna touch a thing.

177
00:13:13,265 --> 00:13:16,219
Mustn't crush. Mustn't kill. Made it.

178
00:13:18,145 --> 00:13:21,431
I wish, I wish
I hadn't killed that fish

179
00:13:28,113 --> 00:13:30,865
Hey, where is everybody?

180
00:13:33,535 --> 00:13:35,742
Hey, there's a bug that looks like Dad.

181
00:13:35,954 --> 00:13:38,310
- Let's kill it.
- Okay.

182
00:13:57,601 --> 00:13:59,724
This is gonna cost me.

183
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:07,604
I mean, hey.

184
00:14:07,778 --> 00:14:10,351
Good morning, Father, dear.
Hope you're well.

185
00:14:10,531 --> 00:14:13,651
Are we taking the Lexus to
Aunt Patty and Selma's funeral today?

186
00:14:13,992 --> 00:14:18,405
Fabulous house, well-behaved kids,
sisters-in-law dead, luxury sedan...

187
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:20,581
I hit the jackpot!

188
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:24,582
Marge, dear, would you
kindly pass me a doughnut?

189
00:14:24,753 --> 00:14:26,627
Doughnut? What's a doughnut?

190
00:14:32,511 --> 00:14:33,886
It's raining again.

191
00:14:37,182 --> 00:14:39,508
You're still not in
your own world, Homer.

192
00:14:39,727 --> 00:14:43,724
I can get you home,
but you have to do exactly as I...

193
00:14:45,607 --> 00:14:48,692
This is indeed a disturbing universe.

194
00:14:49,653 --> 00:14:53,568
Don't touch anything?
I'll touch whatever I feel like!

195
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:09,125
Foolish earthling, totally unprepared
for the effects of time travel.

196
00:15:22,394 --> 00:15:25,160
- What happened to us, Kodos?
- Quiet, you.

197
00:15:33,822 --> 00:15:35,400
- Good morning.
- What's my name?

198
00:15:35,574 --> 00:15:38,824
What color is the sky?
What of doughnuts? What?

199
00:15:38,994 --> 00:15:41,201
For the love of God, tell me!

200
00:15:41,372 --> 00:15:46,800
Homer, the sky is blue, doughnuts are
plentiful, Friday is TGIF night on ABC.

201
00:15:46,251 --> 00:15:47,876
- What's gotten into you?
- Nothing.

202
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:50,666
Nothing at all. Let's just eat.

203
00:15:58,180 --> 00:15:59,805
Close enough.

204
00:16:08,607 --> 00:16:11,312
Hey, everybody!
Let's all turn our desks backwards...

205
00:16:11,485 --> 00:16:13,394
...before Mrs. Krabappel shows up.

206
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:15,650
- Yeah!
- Great idea!

207
00:16:19,618 --> 00:16:22,904
All right, backwards boy,
back your butt down to detention.

208
00:16:25,374 --> 00:16:26,572
Over here, Simpson.

209
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:30,250
The detention room is overcrowded,
so you'll be serving in the cafeteria.

210
00:16:30,421 --> 00:16:31,701
Oxygen running out.

211
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:35,470
You should've thought of that
before you made that paper airplane.

212
00:16:36,677 --> 00:16:39,168
This overcrowding in detention
is becoming critical.

213
00:16:39,346 --> 00:16:42,596
It's a powder keg waiting to go off
in an explosion of bad behavior.

214
00:16:42,766 --> 00:16:44,474
Don't bitch to me, boss man.

215
00:16:44,643 --> 00:16:47,763
Thanks to the latest budget cuts,
I'm down to using Grade F meat.

216
00:16:49,815 --> 00:16:53,350
It would be wonderful if there was a
common solution to both our problems.

217
00:16:53,527 --> 00:16:56,611
- That would be great.
- Hey, Bart. Watch this.

218
00:16:58,407 --> 00:17:01,760
Oh, no! My favorite outfit!

219
00:17:01,243 --> 00:17:04,577
Jimbo, this is by far the worst...

220
00:17:08,208 --> 00:17:12,123
Jimbo, why don't you assist
Lunchlady Doris in the kitchen?

221
00:17:12,296 --> 00:17:14,917
- Bite me, Skinner.
- Well, might we.

222
00:17:15,215 --> 00:17:17,374
It's hard for me
to clean this giant pot...

223
00:17:17,551 --> 00:17:21,200
...when you keep spilling
meat tenderizer all over me.

224
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:24,880
Oh, great!
Now I gotta work in the dark.

225
00:17:30,481 --> 00:17:32,936
This sandwich tastes
so young and impudent.

226
00:17:33,525 --> 00:17:35,601
Seymour, what's with the good grub?

227
00:17:35,778 --> 00:17:38,482
Well, perhaps I ought to
let you folks in on a secret.

228
00:17:38,656 --> 00:17:42,321
You remember me telling Jimbo Jones
that I'd make something of him one day?

229
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:45,486
Are you saying you killed Jimbo...

230
00:17:45,662 --> 00:17:48,782
...processed his carcass,
and served him for lunch?

231
00:17:55,756 --> 00:17:57,380
I wonder where Jimbo is today.

232
00:17:57,591 --> 00:18:00,343
He should've beaten us up
for our lunch money an hour ago.

233
00:18:00,511 --> 00:18:03,962
Frau Lunchlady, please to have
another Sloppy Jimbo?

234
00:18:05,349 --> 00:18:09,347
That's your third helping, young man.
It's making you fat and soft...

235
00:18:10,104 --> 00:18:11,847
...and tender.

236
00:18:13,148 --> 00:18:14,940
You just cut in line, didn't you?

237
00:18:15,109 --> 00:18:17,647
- Report to detention, Uter.
- For how long?

238
00:18:17,861 --> 00:18:20,317
About seven minutes a pound
should do it.

239
00:18:24,326 --> 00:18:27,327
Okay, I got your German grub right here.

240
00:18:29,456 --> 00:18:32,126
Bart, does it strike you as odd
that Uter disappeared...

241
00:18:32,292 --> 00:18:35,827
...and suddenly they're serving us this
mysterious food called "Uterbraten"?

242
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:37,375
Oh, relax, kids.

243
00:18:37,548 --> 00:18:40,999
I've got a gut feeling
Uter's around here somewhere.

244
00:18:42,177 --> 00:18:45,677
After all, isn't there
a little Uter in all of us?

245
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:52,309
In fact, you might even say
we just ate Uter...

246
00:18:52,479 --> 00:18:55,931
...and he's in our stomachs
right now!

247
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:59,818
Wait, scratch that one.

248
00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:01,820
Mom! Mom! You've gotta help!

249
00:19:01,989 --> 00:19:04,444
They're cooking kids
in the school cafeteria!

250
00:19:04,658 --> 00:19:06,984
Listen, kids,
you're 8 and 10 years old now.

251
00:19:07,161 --> 00:19:09,996
- I can't fight all your battles for you.
- But, Mom!

252
00:19:10,205 --> 00:19:12,993
No buts. You march
right back to that school...

253
00:19:13,167 --> 00:19:16,286
...look them straight in the eye
and say, "Don't eat me."

254
00:19:16,462 --> 00:19:18,390
- Okay.
- Okay.

255
00:19:22,593 --> 00:19:26,293
Since so many students have been
put on permanent detention...

256
00:19:27,431 --> 00:19:29,756
...we've merged everyone
into a single class.

257
00:19:29,933 --> 00:19:32,887
I trust there are no objections?

258
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:41,235
Detention.

259
00:19:52,289 --> 00:19:57,746
Hey, you guys, I was just thinking
that any one of us could be next.

260
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:00,837
So, what do you say
we make a break for it?

261
00:20:12,184 --> 00:20:15,434
Easy there, young man. You'll only
make yourself tired and stringy.

262
00:20:15,604 --> 00:20:18,274
Now to check on
the free-range children.

263
00:20:23,988 --> 00:20:25,316
Hold on, kids!

264
00:20:25,489 --> 00:20:28,823
I'm coming to rescue
the lot of you! I'll...

265
00:20:29,994 --> 00:20:31,571
I'm bad at this.

266
00:20:35,749 --> 00:20:39,533
I'm going to enjoy devouring you,
Bart Simpson.

267
00:20:39,712 --> 00:20:44,208
Yes, I believe I'll start
as you've so often suggested...

268
00:20:44,383 --> 00:20:47,520
...by eating your shorts.

269
00:21:00,399 --> 00:21:04,170
Don't worry, guys. Something
always comes along to save us.

270
00:21:06,322 --> 00:21:08,148
Nevertheless, I remain confident...

271
00:21:08,324 --> 00:21:11,609
...that something will come along
and save the two Simpson children.

272
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:21,373
Relax, honey. You were just
having a crazy nightmare.

273
00:21:21,587 --> 00:21:25,170
You're back with your family now,
where there's nothing to be afraid of...

274
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:28,176
...except that fog
that turns people inside out.

275
00:21:29,678 --> 00:21:31,338
It's seeping in.

276
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:33,590
Stupid, cheap weather stripping!

277
00:21:44,526 --> 00:21:47,978
One chorus line of people

278
00:21:48,197 --> 00:21:51,566
Dancing till they make us stop

279
00:21:51,784 --> 00:21:53,492
Two!

280
00:21:53,911 --> 00:21:58,822
Many dancing people
Covered with blood, gore and glop

281
00:21:59,166 --> 00:22:05,667
Just one sniff of that fog
And you're inside out

282
00:22:06,965 --> 00:22:13,170
It's worse than that flesh-eating virus
You've read about

283
00:22:14,265 --> 00:22:17,301
Vital organs
They are what we're dressed in

284
00:22:17,476 --> 00:22:21,426
The family dog is eyeing Bart's intestine

285
00:22:21,647 --> 00:22:27,899
Happy Halloween
