1
00:00:06,395 --> 00:00:08,103
Who Shot Mr. Burns? (Part One)

2
00:00:36,342 --> 00:00:41,680
Is there nothing so intoxicating
as the school hallway at early morn?

3
00:00:42,848 --> 00:00:45,968
The school normally
doesn't smell so rank.

4
00:00:47,394 --> 00:00:51,890
Washbasin fresh. That funk must be
coming from one of the classrooms.

5
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,733
Poor fellow.
Crushed by his own water bottle.

6
00:01:03,827 --> 00:01:07,777
Willie, sometime over the holiday
weekend, the beloved grade-four gerbil...

7
00:01:07,998 --> 00:01:09,790
...Superdude, lost his life.

8
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,535
I need you to air out the classroom
and give Superdude a proper burial.

9
00:01:17,383 --> 00:01:19,459
You're lucky you're getting
a decent burial.

10
00:01:19,635 --> 00:01:22,387
Me own father
got thrown in the bog.

11
00:01:24,807 --> 00:01:27,891
What in the name of
Saint Ephesiocritus...?

12
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:37,939
What reeks?

13
00:01:38,153 --> 00:01:42,317
- Smells like one of van Houten's.
- It does not.

14
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:48,616
Miss Hoover, the floor is shaking.

15
00:01:48,831 --> 00:01:51,535
Ralph, remember the time
you thought the...?

16
00:01:55,379 --> 00:01:59,756
Now, before we adjourn, I have one last
matter of utmost importance.

17
00:01:59,967 --> 00:02:03,418
I need to send this parcel with the profit
projections to Pete Porter in Pasadena.

18
00:02:03,637 --> 00:02:08,180
And it absolutely, positively,
has to be there overnight.

19
00:02:09,184 --> 00:02:11,391
- Pete Porter. Pass it on.
- Pasadena. Promptly.

20
00:02:11,562 --> 00:02:13,104
Package parcel processing.

21
00:02:13,314 --> 00:02:16,765
Perk up. Package of plant profit
projection for Pete Porter in Pasadena.

22
00:02:16,984 --> 00:02:18,727
- Priority?
- Precisely.

23
00:02:30,372 --> 00:02:32,412
Here's your package, Mr. Burns.

24
00:02:34,168 --> 00:02:37,418
My name is the return address,
you senseless dunderpate.

25
00:02:37,588 --> 00:02:39,212
Smithers, who is this nincompoop?

26
00:02:40,382 --> 00:02:43,834
I've worked here for 10 years and
my boss doesn't even know my name.

27
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:45,968
Well, that's gonna change right now.

28
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:48,256
My name is Homer J. Simp...

29
00:02:48,724 --> 00:02:51,476
...son.
- Sounded large when I ordered it.

30
00:02:51,685 --> 00:02:54,935
I can't make hide nor hair
of these metric booby traps.

31
00:02:55,939 --> 00:02:58,940
My Lord. Such destruction.

32
00:03:00,694 --> 00:03:02,983
Superintendent Chalmers.
How are you going?

33
00:03:03,197 --> 00:03:06,482
Why is it when I heard the word
"school" and the word "exploded"...

34
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,693
...I thought of the word "Skinner"?!

35
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:12,193
Congratulations, gentlemen.
Your custodian struck oil.

36
00:03:12,414 --> 00:03:16,282
You're standing on top of the richest
elementary school in the state.

37
00:03:16,794 --> 00:03:18,502
We also found this.

38
00:03:19,254 --> 00:03:21,330
Thank you. Superdude.

39
00:03:29,765 --> 00:03:32,552
A nonprofit organization with oil?
I won't allow it.

40
00:03:32,726 --> 00:03:34,849
An oil well doesn't belong
in the hands of...

41
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,511
...Betsy Bleeding-heart
and Maynard G. Muskie-vote.

42
00:03:38,482 --> 00:03:42,895
Sir, have you had enough
exercise for this morning?

43
00:03:43,112 --> 00:03:44,440
No.

44
00:03:45,197 --> 00:03:47,273
Let's do another 20 miles.

45
00:03:56,375 --> 00:04:00,750
Hello, Lenny, Carl, Guillermo.
Hello...

46
00:04:04,466 --> 00:04:07,800
Don't take it so hard, Homer. He's
always screwing up people's names.

47
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,763
At the picnic, he thought my son
Reynaldo was Rolando.

48
00:04:10,931 --> 00:04:11,962
Can you believe it?

49
00:04:15,394 --> 00:04:17,517
Superintendent,
we made the front page today.

50
00:04:20,482 --> 00:04:23,982
- What's that say under your hand there?
- Oh, it's an unrelated article.

51
00:04:24,194 --> 00:04:26,270
It's an unrelated article.

52
00:04:26,488 --> 00:04:27,899
Within the banner headline.

53
00:04:28,115 --> 00:04:30,108
Yes. Now, to redirect our
conversation...

54
00:04:30,284 --> 00:04:32,276
...I have ideas on
spending this oil money.

55
00:04:32,494 --> 00:04:35,495
Well, we could give each student
a full college scholarship.

56
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,542
Oh, mercy.

57
00:04:45,758 --> 00:04:47,418
Before we draw up the budget...

58
00:04:47,634 --> 00:04:50,126
...the students and faculty
have a few suggestions.

59
00:04:50,387 --> 00:04:55,726
I want a crystal bucket for my slop
water. And a brand-new filthy blanket.

60
00:04:57,645 --> 00:05:01,428
The cafeteria staff is complaining
about the mice in the kitchen.

61
00:05:01,607 --> 00:05:03,350
I wanna hire a new staff.

62
00:05:04,902 --> 00:05:07,607
I'd like to start a jazz program
in the music department.

63
00:05:07,821 --> 00:05:09,897
We've got a
great instructor lined up.

64
00:05:12,409 --> 00:05:13,785
- Tito Puente!
- Tito Puente!

65
00:05:15,829 --> 00:05:18,617
He's ready to give up
the professional mambo circuit...

66
00:05:18,791 --> 00:05:20,748
...and settle into
a nice teaching job.

67
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:23,332
Man, it would be my pleasure.

68
00:05:23,545 --> 00:05:27,839
Lisa has told me all your students are as
bright and dedicated to jazz as she is.

69
00:05:29,301 --> 00:05:30,843
Let's go now, Mr. Puente.

70
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:33,922
Chocolate microscopes.

71
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:37,508
You know those guitars that are,
like, double guitars, you know?

72
00:05:37,726 --> 00:05:39,220
More rubber stamps.

73
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:43,639
Principal Skinner, this is your secretary.
One last student to see you.

74
00:05:43,816 --> 00:05:46,141
That's odd.
I don't have a secretary.

75
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,483
Or an intercom.
But send them in.

76
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:53,318
Ahoy there, dean. I understand you're
taking suggestions from students, eh?

77
00:05:55,577 --> 00:05:59,492
Well, me and my fourth-form chums
think it would be quite corking...

78
00:05:59,665 --> 00:06:03,248
...if you'd sign over your oil well
to the local energy concern.

79
00:06:03,419 --> 00:06:04,747
Mr. Burns...

80
00:06:04,962 --> 00:06:07,453
It's naive of you to think
I'd mistake this town's...

81
00:06:07,631 --> 00:06:10,917
...most prominent 104-year-old man
for an elementary school student.

82
00:06:11,135 --> 00:06:14,171
I want that oil well.
I've got a monopoly to maintain.

83
00:06:14,346 --> 00:06:18,470
I own the electric company, waterworks,
plus the hotel on Baltic Avenue.

84
00:06:18,267 --> 00:06:20,592
That hotel's a dump and
your monopoly's pathetic.

85
00:06:20,769 --> 00:06:25,630
The oil well is not for sale, particularly to
a black-hearted scoundrel like yourself.

86
00:06:25,274 --> 00:06:26,602
I see.

87
00:06:26,775 --> 00:06:32,149
Then I'll just have to attack you.
I must have that oil.

88
00:06:34,158 --> 00:06:38,286
Smithers. Smithers,
help me subdue this beast.

89
00:06:38,495 --> 00:06:41,745
Sorry, sir. This was all I could find.
Take that. And that.

90
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:45,497
Please don't waste those.

91
00:06:49,798 --> 00:06:51,127
I'm happy for the school.

92
00:06:51,342 --> 00:06:54,177
Sounds like this money is gonna
provide new opportunities.

93
00:06:54,386 --> 00:06:57,636
Big deal. They didn't approve my idea.
Said it was unfeasible.

94
00:06:57,848 --> 00:07:00,540
It is unfeasible
to resurrect the dead, Bart.

95
00:07:00,225 --> 00:07:03,808
And even if the Three Stooges were
alive, I doubt they'd hang out with you.

96
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:07,105
I guess they'd wanna be with
their families or something, huh?

97
00:07:07,316 --> 00:07:08,893
Oh, I hate my job.

98
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,104
What's the point when your boss
doesn't even remember your name?

99
00:07:12,321 --> 00:07:14,812
- I have an idea.
- What? What's your idea?

100
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,523
When my father was trying
to catch my mother's eye...

101
00:07:17,701 --> 00:07:19,943
...he sent her a box of candy
with his photo.

102
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:23,380
- After that, she never forgot him.
- That's all well and good.

103
00:07:23,207 --> 00:07:26,124
But it's not really your idea,
is it, now, Marge?

104
00:07:26,919 --> 00:07:30,833
That's it. Frimble about with
your widgets and doobobs.

105
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,790
It will all be a monument to futility
when my plan comes to fruition.

106
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,380
Sir.

107
00:07:36,929 --> 00:07:40,132
What I'm about to say violates
every sycophantic urge in my body...

108
00:07:40,307 --> 00:07:43,225
...but I wish you'd reconsider.
This isn't a rival company...

109
00:07:43,394 --> 00:07:46,395
...it's a school. They won't stand for it.
- Pishposh.

110
00:07:46,563 --> 00:07:49,101
It will be like taking
candy from a baby.

111
00:07:49,316 --> 00:07:51,356
Say, that sounds like a "larf."

112
00:07:51,568 --> 00:07:53,561
Let's try it right now.

113
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,566
There's candy right here. Why
don't we eat this instead of stealing.

114
00:07:58,742 --> 00:08:00,402
Oh, very well.

115
00:08:05,582 --> 00:08:08,334
- Oh, look. There's a photo in here.
- Oh, yes.

116
00:08:08,502 --> 00:08:13,164
That's little Maggie Simpson, the baby
who found my teddy bear Bobo.

117
00:08:13,382 --> 00:08:16,751
And there's that Simpson mutt,
my former guard dog.

118
00:08:18,721 --> 00:08:22,137
And that's Bart Simpson. He was my
heir for a brief period, you know.

119
00:08:22,307 --> 00:08:24,347
Yes, sir. I remember.

120
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:29,350
Anything left?

121
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,230
Only the sour quince log, sir.

122
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:34,939
Dispose of it.

123
00:08:35,362 --> 00:08:40,867
And send a thank-you note to
Marge, Bart, Lisa and Maggie Simpson.

124
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:50,628
Today, Springfield Elementary
embarks on a new era of...

125
00:08:50,794 --> 00:08:54,709
...unbridled spending where petrodollars
fuel our wildest educational fantasies.

126
00:08:54,882 --> 00:08:58,417
These young minds will enjoy every
academic advantage...

127
00:08:58,969 --> 00:09:02,136
...till they enter Springfield High School,
which has no oil well.

128
00:09:02,306 --> 00:09:05,805
- We got an air hockey table.
- Fine. Now, to switch on our oil pump...

129
00:09:05,976 --> 00:09:10,270
...for the very first time, here's our
top student, Lisa Simpson.

130
00:09:10,481 --> 00:09:11,560
Nerd!

131
00:09:18,906 --> 00:09:20,448
There's no pressure.

132
00:09:20,658 --> 00:09:23,861
- Someone else has tapped this well.
- Ay caramba!

133
00:09:34,838 --> 00:09:38,753
Soon that mighty apparatus will
burst forth with its precious fluid.

134
00:09:38,967 --> 00:09:41,256
Almost sexual, isn't it, Smithers?

135
00:09:43,514 --> 00:09:45,138
Oil ho!

136
00:09:47,101 --> 00:09:48,892
Huzzah!

137
00:10:14,169 --> 00:10:16,791
Holy Christmas!

138
00:10:20,467 --> 00:10:23,587
Your dog's condition has been
upgraded from stable to frisky.

139
00:10:23,762 --> 00:10:26,847
He's free to go. His leg should
be good as new in a few months.

140
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,507
In the meantime,
he'll have to use the wheel-about.

141
00:10:30,394 --> 00:10:34,261
I'll get even with whoever did this
to you, boy. I swear it.

142
00:10:34,523 --> 00:10:37,939
I almost forgot. Wouldn't want
you gnawing on those casts, eh, boy?

143
00:10:42,239 --> 00:10:45,904
We've got no legal recourse against
Mr. Burns' slant-drilling operation.

144
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,199
The oil belongs to whoever
pumped it first.

145
00:10:48,412 --> 00:10:51,448
What about the expensive stuff
we wanted? Can we still have it?

146
00:10:51,665 --> 00:10:53,159
No.

147
00:10:54,251 --> 00:10:55,414
Blast it!

148
00:10:55,628 --> 00:10:59,210
To pay for the construction, operation
and demolition of the derrick...

149
00:10:59,381 --> 00:11:01,789
...we have to cut nonessential programs.
Music...

150
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,480
- What?!
- And maintenance.

151
00:11:05,346 --> 00:11:08,970
I'll kill that Mr. Burns!

152
00:11:08,265 --> 00:11:13,307
And wound that Mr. Smithers.
Out of my way.

153
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:16,580
Oh, no. That's awful, Mr. Puente.

154
00:11:16,732 --> 00:11:18,600
What?

155
00:11:18,233 --> 00:11:23,572
He owns the nuclear power plant.
Yeah, I'd like to settle his hash too.

156
00:11:23,781 --> 00:11:26,153
Dad, how can you work
for a man like Mr. Burns?

157
00:11:26,367 --> 00:11:29,118
He's not all bad. He did send me
this nice thank-you card.

158
00:11:29,328 --> 00:11:33,539
"Marge, Bart, Lisa and Maggie."
Dad, this doesn't have your name on it.

159
00:11:37,544 --> 00:11:40,462
Kids, would you
step outside for a second?

160
00:11:47,137 --> 00:11:50,910
Dear Lord. That's the loudest
profanity I've ever heard.

161
00:11:52,768 --> 00:11:56,813
These fumes aren't as fun as beer.
Sure, I'm all dizzy and nauseous...

162
00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:00,184
...but where's the inflated sense
of self-esteem?

163
00:12:03,988 --> 00:12:07,736
Hey, if you guys are getting loaded off
them fumes, I'll have to charge you.

164
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:10,785
Man alive!
There are men alive in here.

165
00:12:10,995 --> 00:12:14,280
I'm detecting over
20 different toxins in the air.

166
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:19,874
Everybody out. As long as
Burns is pumping oil, this bar is closed.

167
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:23,670
Damn Burns.
Let me just get one thing.

168
00:12:25,342 --> 00:12:31,796
Me too. Now, there's the
inflated sense of self-esteem.

169
00:12:42,276 --> 00:12:44,482
Earthquake!

170
00:12:49,742 --> 00:12:51,818
- Nurse!
- Nurse! Nurse!

171
00:13:00,878 --> 00:13:03,360
Well, sir, you've
vanquished all your enemies.

172
00:13:03,213 --> 00:13:07,377
The elementary school, local tavern,
the old-age home. You must be proud.

173
00:13:07,593 --> 00:13:11,920
No, not while my greatest nemesis still
provides our customers...

174
00:13:11,263 --> 00:13:13,137
...with free light, heat and energy.

175
00:13:13,682 --> 00:13:17,182
I call this enemy... the sun.

176
00:13:26,236 --> 00:13:29,356
Since the beginning of time,
man has yearned to destroy the sun.

177
00:13:29,573 --> 00:13:31,732
I will do the next best thing:

178
00:13:32,117 --> 00:13:33,909
Block it out.

179
00:13:38,582 --> 00:13:40,990
- Good God!
- Imagine it, Smithers.

180
00:13:41,168 --> 00:13:44,204
Electrical lights and heaters
running all day long.

181
00:13:44,421 --> 00:13:46,793
But, sir, every plant
and tree will die.

182
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:50,875
Owls will deafen us with incessant
hooting. The sundial will be useless.

183
00:13:52,221 --> 00:13:56,633
I don't want any part of this project.
It's unconscionably fiendish.

184
00:13:56,809 --> 00:13:58,351
I won't suffer your insubordination.

185
00:13:58,519 --> 00:14:02,351
There has been a shocking decline in the
quality and quantity of your toadying.

186
00:14:02,564 --> 00:14:04,391
And you will fall into line. Now!

187
00:14:05,192 --> 00:14:07,683
No. No, Monty, I won't.

188
00:14:07,903 --> 00:14:10,608
Not until you step back
from the brink of insanity.

189
00:14:10,823 --> 00:14:14,192
I'll do no such thing. You're fired.

190
00:14:20,791 --> 00:14:23,364
Take that, Bowl-a-rama.
Take that, convenience mart.

191
00:14:23,585 --> 00:14:25,827
Take that, nuclear power pla...

192
00:14:26,463 --> 00:14:27,792
Oh, fiddlesticks.

193
00:14:33,887 --> 00:14:37,932
I must say, Mr. Burns is being
awfully inconsiderate. Selfish, even.

194
00:14:38,142 --> 00:14:41,178
Burns needs some serious
"boostafazoo." Right, Dad?

195
00:14:41,895 --> 00:14:44,386
Dad. Homer.

196
00:14:46,609 --> 00:14:49,942
Sorry, Grampa. It's just, for a second,
it looked like Dad had melted.

197
00:14:50,112 --> 00:14:52,520
Well, get used to it,
because I'm living here now.

198
00:14:52,698 --> 00:14:56,778
I ain't going back to the home until they
fish my bed out of that sinkhole.

199
00:14:56,952 --> 00:15:00,119
Strained carrots for Maggie.
Strained carrots for Grampa.

200
00:15:00,331 --> 00:15:01,908
I want a bib too.

201
00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:06,494
Smithers, who is that ignoramus?
Smithers, who is that lollygagger?

202
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:08,959
Who is that blubber-pot?
Who is that bafflewit?

203
00:15:09,131 --> 00:15:11,124
Lummox. Puddinghead.
Mooncalf. Limpnoodle.

204
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:12,628
Goldbricker. Drizzlepuss...

205
00:15:12,801 --> 00:15:15,506
- Stop it. Stop it. Stop it!
- Look out!

206
00:15:15,721 --> 00:15:16,884
What?

207
00:15:19,266 --> 00:15:21,888
Just a minute.

208
00:15:33,906 --> 00:15:35,566
Who the devil are you?

209
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:40,746
- Homer Simpson.
- What? What are you talking about?

210
00:15:40,913 --> 00:15:42,455
- Homer Simpson.
- Make sense, man.

211
00:15:42,623 --> 00:15:46,917
- I can't understand a word you're saying.
- My name is Homer Simpson.

212
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:51,350
Oh, you're a dead man, Burns.
Oh, you're dead. You're dead, Burns!

213
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:55,708
- Hey, the lamp's running away.
- That's my dog, man.

214
00:15:55,886 --> 00:16:00,382
So long, lamp. Now, stop loafing
and help your Grampa unpack.

215
00:16:03,185 --> 00:16:05,391
That's my old Smith & Wesson.

216
00:16:05,562 --> 00:16:08,267
If you're gonna play with it,
be careful. It's loaded.

217
00:16:08,732 --> 00:16:10,610
Bart, put that down!

218
00:16:10,317 --> 00:16:13,220
Guns are dangerous. And I won't
have them in this house.

219
00:16:14,113 --> 00:16:16,319
How can you have a house
without a gun?

220
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:18,364
What if a bear came through the door?

221
00:16:19,785 --> 00:16:23,118
I'm going to bury it in the yard
where little hands can't get to it.

222
00:16:23,455 --> 00:16:26,770
You should've fired into the air.
She would've run off.

223
00:16:28,836 --> 00:16:30,912
People, take it easy.

224
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:34,830
We're all upset about Mr. Burns'
plan to block out our sun.

225
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,541
It is time for decisive action.

226
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:41,302
I have here a polite but firm letter
to Mr. Burns' underlings...

227
00:16:41,515 --> 00:16:44,931
...who, with some cajoling,
will pass it along to him...

228
00:16:45,102 --> 00:16:47,141
...or at least
give him the gist of it.

229
00:16:47,313 --> 00:16:49,139
Sir, a lot of people
are stroking guns.

230
00:16:49,315 --> 00:16:52,648
It has been brought to my attention
a number of you are stroking guns.

231
00:16:52,818 --> 00:16:55,107
Therefore I'll step aside
and open up the floor.

232
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:59,899
Mr. Burns was the closest thing
I ever had to a friend.

233
00:17:00,492 --> 00:17:01,821
But he fired me.

234
00:17:01,994 --> 00:17:05,861
And now I spend my days drinking cheap
Scotch and watching Comedy Central.

235
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:09,616
- Oh, dear God.
- It's not that bad. I mean...

236
00:17:09,793 --> 00:17:11,453
...I never miss Pardon My Zinger.

237
00:17:11,628 --> 00:17:14,120
Burns cost me my
groundskeeping job at the school.

238
00:17:14,298 --> 00:17:17,464
And I'm too superstitious to take
the one at the cemetery.

239
00:17:17,801 --> 00:17:20,800
Because of him, I lost my room...

240
00:17:20,179 --> 00:17:24,591
...my things and my buddy's collection
of old sunbathing magazines.

241
00:17:24,808 --> 00:17:26,137
You bastard.

242
00:17:26,352 --> 00:17:29,210
- I lost my bar.
- I lost his bar.

243
00:17:29,229 --> 00:17:30,937
He robbed the school of music.

244
00:17:31,106 --> 00:17:34,309
- He robbed it of financial security.
- He robbed the school of Tito.

245
00:17:34,485 --> 00:17:37,402
- He can't remember my name!
- He's causing us all to yell!

246
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:40,404
Look what he did to my best friend.

247
00:17:42,326 --> 00:17:43,868
No, my dog.

248
00:17:51,377 --> 00:17:53,915
Those wheels are squeaking a bit.

249
00:17:54,129 --> 00:17:56,169
Perhaps I could sell him a little oil.

250
00:17:58,175 --> 00:18:00,333
You twisted old monster!

251
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:05,758
I've decided to protect myself...

252
00:18:05,974 --> 00:18:09,593
...ever since I was attacked in my office
by an unidentified assailant.

253
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:16,580
Burns, your scurvy schemes will earn ye
a one-way passage to the boneyard.

254
00:18:16,276 --> 00:18:18,353
I'd like to hear from Sideshow Mel.

255
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:24,691
I'll see that Mr. Burns suffers the infernal
machinations of hell's grim tyrant.

256
00:18:24,868 --> 00:18:27,490
- Yeah.
- Oh, you all talk big.

257
00:18:27,871 --> 00:18:31,205
But who here
has the guts to stop me?

258
00:18:36,755 --> 00:18:39,246
Very well. One last question.

259
00:18:39,466 --> 00:18:44,450
Have you ever seen
the sun set at 3 p. M?

260
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:47,468
Once, when I was
sailing around the Arctic...

261
00:18:47,641 --> 00:18:52,220
Shut up, you. Take one last look
at the sun, Springfield.

262
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:14,661
Hey, hey!

263
00:19:15,753 --> 00:19:18,837
I've been in Reno for six weeks.
Did I miss anything?

264
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,790
What the...?

265
00:19:22,968 --> 00:19:26,384
Eternal darkness.
Well, that's just great.

266
00:19:26,555 --> 00:19:28,797
Listen, someone's
got to get that Mr. Burns.

267
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,637
Where's a gun-toting lowlife
when you need one?

268
00:19:31,810 --> 00:19:33,720
Sorry, I was in the can.

269
00:19:37,566 --> 00:19:42,524
Perpetual twilight. Bathed in
the glow of Burns brand electricity.

270
00:19:43,697 --> 00:19:46,449
Hello, lamppost. What you knowing?

271
00:19:46,658 --> 00:19:50,158
I've come to watch
your power flowing.

272
00:19:52,873 --> 00:19:55,446
That's odd. Mr. Smithers
left his jacket behind.

273
00:19:58,462 --> 00:20:01,748
That's odd. Principal Skinner
left his mother behind.

274
00:20:08,263 --> 00:20:12,641
That's odd. Where's Homer? And Bart?
And Lisa? And Grampa?

275
00:20:18,399 --> 00:20:22,313
After all these years, things are
finally starting to go my way.

276
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:24,730
I feel like celebrating.

277
00:20:25,864 --> 00:20:28,190
Oh, it's you.
What are you so happy about?

278
00:20:28,867 --> 00:20:31,868
I see. I think you'd better drop it.

279
00:20:32,121 --> 00:20:34,612
I said, drop it!

280
00:20:36,667 --> 00:20:40,830
Get your hands off.

281
00:20:40,296 --> 00:20:42,418
Where is everybody?

282
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:49,430
Hey, man. Are you okay?

283
00:20:50,889 --> 00:20:54,934
Won't... dignify that... with a response.

284
00:20:58,220 --> 00:20:59,895
Mr. Burns has been shot.

285
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:03,434
Just a minute.
This isn't Mr. Burns at all.

286
00:21:03,652 --> 00:21:05,280
It's a mask.

287
00:21:08,782 --> 00:21:10,360
Oh, wait, it is Burns.

288
00:21:10,909 --> 00:21:12,701
His wrinkly skin looks like a mask.

289
00:21:12,911 --> 00:21:17,490
I don't think we'll ever know who
did this. Everyone in town's a suspect.

290
00:21:25,924 --> 00:21:28,415
Well, I couldn't possibly
solve this mystery.

291
00:21:28,802 --> 00:21:31,293
Can you?

292
00:21:33,265 --> 00:21:36,681
Yeah, I'll give it a shot.
I mean, you know, it's my job, right?

293
00:22:33,367 --> 00:22:35,443
