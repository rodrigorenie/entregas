1
00:00:06,437 --> 00:00:07,895
BART'S COMET

2
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:35,630
And now, to top off...

3
00:00:35,799 --> 00:00:38,551
...our most propane-explosion-free
Science Week ever...

4
00:00:38,761 --> 00:00:41,880
...our grand finale:
The launching of a weather balloon.

5
00:00:43,641 --> 00:00:47,560
Go, weather balloon!
Hurrah for science, whoo!

6
00:00:47,269 --> 00:00:49,476
"Hurrah for science, whoo"?

7
00:00:49,647 --> 00:00:53,596
I can't say I approve of the "whoo,"
but the "hurrah" was quite heartening.

8
00:00:53,776 --> 00:00:55,768
Release the balloon.

9
00:00:55,986 --> 00:00:58,442
- Yeah!
- All right!

10
00:01:11,877 --> 00:01:15,328
No!

11
00:01:18,258 --> 00:01:21,793
- I don't think I really captured the eyes.
- Bart, if you have a failing...

12
00:01:21,971 --> 00:01:24,296
...it's that you're always
demanding perfection.

13
00:01:24,473 --> 00:01:25,884
If you have a failing.

14
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:30,560
Whoever brings down that balloon
doesn't have to learn fractions.

15
00:01:34,274 --> 00:01:36,660
Careful, children. That's my car.

16
00:01:40,197 --> 00:01:43,364
- Destroy that balloon.
- Aye.

17
00:01:45,285 --> 00:01:48,785
Tango 14, we're being fired at.
I'm getting an ID on the bogey now.

18
00:01:52,376 --> 00:01:55,810
Iraqis again.
Launching Sidewinder missile.

19
00:01:58,716 --> 00:02:01,835
Missed him.
Launching second Sidewinder missile.

20
00:02:06,557 --> 00:02:09,511
This is what happens when
you cut money out of the military...

21
00:02:09,685 --> 00:02:12,223
...and put it into healthcare.
- It's a good program.

22
00:02:12,396 --> 00:02:15,170
Just give it a chance, that's all I ask.

23
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:24,697
It won't come down for months.
Curse the man who invented helium.

24
00:02:24,867 --> 00:02:27,239
Curse Pierre Jules César Janssen.

25
00:02:27,786 --> 00:02:29,909
Now to find out who did this.

26
00:02:30,414 --> 00:02:33,498
- Bart, empty your pockets.
- Empty my pockets, you say?

27
00:02:33,667 --> 00:02:37,665
Well, certainly,
but I fail to see how...

28
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:42,127
Blueprints of the dummy, notarized
photos of you making the dummy...

29
00:02:42,384 --> 00:02:44,377
...and an alternate wording
for the banner.

30
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:49,298
- Race you to Utah, Milhouse.
- Okay.

31
00:02:49,892 --> 00:02:52,217
I am going to punish you
for this, Bart.

32
00:02:52,394 --> 00:02:54,766
And it won't just be
a simple caning this time.

33
00:02:54,938 --> 00:02:59,766
Because you have impeded science,
you must now aid science.

34
00:02:59,943 --> 00:03:04,570
Yes. Starting tomorrow, you will
assist me with my amateur astronomy.

35
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:07,575
Taking down coordinates,
carrying equipment and so forth.

36
00:03:07,743 --> 00:03:10,578
- Four-thirty in the morning.
- There's a 4:30 in the morning now?

37
00:03:13,999 --> 00:03:18,163
Top of the hour, time for the news.
But of course, there is no news yet.

38
00:03:18,337 --> 00:03:23,248
Everyone's still asleep in their comfy,
comfy beds. Good night, everybody.

39
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:28,714
Mom, will you make me breakfast?

40
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:33,592
There's a stuffed pepper
in the trash from last night.

41
00:03:33,769 --> 00:03:35,762
Just rinse it good.

42
00:03:36,188 --> 00:03:39,639
Come on, Lassie. Here, boy.
Come on, girl.

43
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,103
Attaboy.

44
00:03:53,205 --> 00:03:56,159
Still dark. Better use the generator.

45
00:04:10,556 --> 00:04:12,548
There's nothing more
exciting than science.

46
00:04:12,766 --> 00:04:15,601
You get all the fun of sitting still,
being quiet...

47
00:04:15,769 --> 00:04:18,391
...writing down numbers,
paying attention.

48
00:04:18,564 --> 00:04:20,230
Science has it all.

49
00:04:20,232 --> 00:04:22,225
Is that the telescope
we'll look through?

50
00:04:22,401 --> 00:04:25,734
Yes, but you won't be looking
through it. I forbid it.

51
00:04:25,904 --> 00:04:28,312
But you don't need a telescope
to enjoy astronomy.

52
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:31,444
There are all the constellations
you've heard so much about.

53
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:35,195
There's Orion, the Swan,
the Chariot Race.

54
00:04:35,372 --> 00:04:37,614
Why don't they look anything
like their names?

55
00:04:37,833 --> 00:04:39,624
You do have to use your imagination.

56
00:04:39,835 --> 00:04:42,770
Look, there's the Three Wise Men.

57
00:04:42,254 --> 00:04:43,665
Who names these things?

58
00:04:43,881 --> 00:04:46,917
Whoever discovers them.
I've been hoping I can find something...

59
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,930
...that would be named after me.
- You've never found anything?

60
00:04:50,262 --> 00:04:53,140
Once. But by the time
I got to a phone...

61
00:04:53,182 --> 00:04:57,262
...my discovery had already been
reported by Principal Kohoutek.

62
00:04:57,436 --> 00:05:01,813
I got back at him, though.
Him and that little boy of his.

63
00:05:01,982 --> 00:05:04,900
Anyway, that's why I always keep
a cellular phone next to me.

64
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:07,610
Now, this morning we're
gonna be mapping...

65
00:05:07,237 --> 00:05:10,322
...a square of sky that's thought
to be empty. I hope it's not.

66
00:05:10,532 --> 00:05:12,691
So, what am I supposed
to do exactly?

67
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:15,401
Just write down my findings
as I give them to you.

68
00:05:15,579 --> 00:05:20,822
Six hours, 19 minutes right ascension,
14 degrees, 22 minutes declination.

69
00:05:21,377 --> 00:05:22,871
No sighting.

70
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:28,759
Six hours, 19 minutes right ascension,
14 degrees, 23 minutes declination.

71
00:05:29,677 --> 00:05:31,301
No sighting.

72
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:37,307
Six hours, 19 minutes right ascension,
14 degrees, 58 minutes declination.

73
00:05:39,186 --> 00:05:41,600
No sighting.
Did you get that one, Bart?

74
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:42,973
- Hell, no.
- Good.

75
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,620
My stars. Give me the phone, quick.

76
00:05:48,487 --> 00:05:52,271
Check out 6-19-14-59.

77
00:05:59,289 --> 00:06:03,619
No. No, there's no need for that.
It's already named after me.

78
00:06:03,836 --> 00:06:06,540
It's pretty close to the ground.
Maybe I can catch it.

79
00:06:06,714 --> 00:06:10,794
Don't touch the telescope, Bart.
Even a slight change in elevation...

80
00:06:10,968 --> 00:06:13,174
...can destroy a whole morning's work.

81
00:06:19,184 --> 00:06:22,388
All hands on deck.
Pirates off the port bow.

82
00:06:22,563 --> 00:06:24,639
Hey.

83
00:06:30,237 --> 00:06:32,775
Observatory? This is Bart Simpson.

84
00:06:32,948 --> 00:06:38,250
I see something in the sky at 4-12-8,
and the last number is seven.

85
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:46,994
Got you, my rumpy doppelgänger.

86
00:06:48,714 --> 00:06:52,213
I've got it. What are you doing?
Give me that phone.

87
00:06:52,426 --> 00:06:55,629
Congratulations, Bart.
You've just discovered a comet.

88
00:06:55,804 --> 00:06:59,800
No!

89
00:07:00,434 --> 00:07:04,348
No!

90
00:07:06,315 --> 00:07:10,443
No!

91
00:07:16,533 --> 00:07:20,680
And then I sped away without
anyone seeing my license plate.

92
00:07:20,287 --> 00:07:22,790
Sounds like you had a good day, Dad.

93
00:07:22,247 --> 00:07:25,747
Yeah. Except I forgot to go to work.

94
00:07:25,918 --> 00:07:27,495
What did you do today, Bart?

95
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:29,911
What didn't I do?

96
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:32,400
- "Boy Discovers Comet."
- What?

97
00:07:32,174 --> 00:07:35,450
"A young Springfieldianite
has discovered a new comet...

98
00:07:35,219 --> 00:07:37,544
...to be known as
the Bart Simpson Comet."

99
00:07:37,721 --> 00:07:40,343
Oh, honey, I'm so proud of you.

100
00:07:40,516 --> 00:07:43,185
But then you've always
been proud of me.

101
00:07:43,978 --> 00:07:45,388
Yes.

102
00:07:50,943 --> 00:07:52,900
Won't you join us, Bart?

103
00:07:57,783 --> 00:07:59,111
I guess so.

104
00:07:59,284 --> 00:08:03,578
As the first student at Springfield
Elementary to discover a comet...

105
00:08:03,747 --> 00:08:07,875
...we're very proud to make you
a member of our very select group.

106
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:10,914
Welcome to Super Friends!

107
00:08:11,588 --> 00:08:13,628
Welcome, Super Friend!

108
00:08:13,799 --> 00:08:18,100
I am called Ham,
since I enjoy Ham Radio.

109
00:08:18,178 --> 00:08:24,762
This is E-Mail, Cosine, Report Card,
Database and Lisa.

110
00:08:24,935 --> 00:08:27,604
Your nickname will be Cosmos.

111
00:08:29,773 --> 00:08:31,315
Well, I'm done eating. Goodbye.

112
00:08:31,483 --> 00:08:34,318
- Goodbye, Cosmos.
- Bye-bye.

113
00:08:34,486 --> 00:08:36,812
Perhaps some night
you could show us your comet.

114
00:08:36,989 --> 00:08:39,195
- There it is right there.
- I make it a point...

115
00:08:39,366 --> 00:08:42,710
...never turn my head unless
I expect to see something.

116
00:08:42,244 --> 00:08:46,953
Naturally, we can't see your comet in
broad daylight and without a telescope.

117
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:51,246
But you don't need a stupid telescope.
It's right there.

118
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:54,874
Oh, no, no! This isn't right at all!

119
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:58,464
It must be coming toward us
at a fantastic speed.

120
00:08:59,178 --> 00:09:02,547
Don't you realize what's happening?
Your comet will collide with Earth.

121
00:09:02,723 --> 00:09:04,632
Everything in its path will be killed.

122
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:07,555
I knew you'd try to find something
wrong with my comet.

123
00:09:07,728 --> 00:09:10,978
You've always been petty and small,
right from the beginning.

124
00:09:11,148 --> 00:09:15,442
- We must alert the proper authorities.
- To the observatory!

125
00:09:19,657 --> 00:09:21,733
We are the Super Friends

126
00:09:21,909 --> 00:09:23,451
Hey, shut up.

127
00:09:28,624 --> 00:09:30,201
- Dear God!
- Warren...

128
00:09:30,376 --> 00:09:33,163
...we've talked about you
hogging the eyepiece.

129
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,672
Sounds like the Doomsday Whistle.

130
00:09:40,886 --> 00:09:45,465
Ain't been blown
for nigh on to three years.

131
00:09:46,266 --> 00:09:47,595
Trouble a-brewing.

132
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:52,222
Fellow citizens, when I learned
about the impending crisis...

133
00:09:52,398 --> 00:09:55,564
...I caught the very next plane
to Springfeld. Field.

134
00:09:58,279 --> 00:10:03,439
First, yes, there is a comet in the sky.
And yes, it is going to hit Springfield.

135
00:10:05,494 --> 00:10:07,360
You don't need to applaud that.

136
00:10:07,204 --> 00:10:10,454
Now, here's what we think
the impact might look like.

137
00:10:10,666 --> 00:10:12,326
Show them, Jerry.

138
00:10:18,424 --> 00:10:19,882
Oh, dear God, no!

139
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,258
Fortunately, we have a plan.
Professor Frink?

140
00:10:25,431 --> 00:10:27,910
Hi. Good evening, ladies and...

141
00:10:27,266 --> 00:10:29,555
Einstein, what's the plan?!

142
00:10:29,852 --> 00:10:31,761
All right, just take your seat.

143
00:10:31,937 --> 00:10:34,772
Now, working with former
Carter-administration officials...

144
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:37,858
...and military men who were
forced into early retirement...

145
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:40,778
For various reasons which
we won't go into here, okay?

146
00:10:40,988 --> 00:10:43,395
- We have planned this defense
for the city.

147
00:10:43,657 --> 00:10:47,821
As the comet hurdles toward the city,
our rocket will intercept it...

148
00:10:47,995 --> 00:10:50,710
...and blow it to smithereens. Right!

149
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:56,840
That will be the end of our Mr. Comet.

150
00:10:56,503 --> 00:10:58,211
We're saved!

151
00:11:08,849 --> 00:11:12,633
Will you all stop worrying about that
stupid comet? It's going to be destroyed.

152
00:11:12,811 --> 00:11:15,219
Didn't you hear what that guy
in the building said?

153
00:11:15,397 --> 00:11:17,556
- But, Dad, don't you think...?
- Lisa.

154
00:11:17,775 --> 00:11:22,437
The reason we have elected officials
is so we don't have to think all the time.

155
00:11:22,613 --> 00:11:25,697
Just like that rain-forest scare
a few years back.

156
00:11:25,908 --> 00:11:29,277
Our officials saw there was a problem,
and they fixed it, didn't they?

157
00:11:29,453 --> 00:11:32,122
- No, Dad. I don't think...
- There's that word again.

158
00:11:55,145 --> 00:11:58,645
- Homer, what if this doesn't work?
- Well, then I have a backup plan.

159
00:11:58,816 --> 00:12:01,567
See, while the unprepared
are still sitting around...

160
00:12:01,735 --> 00:12:04,570
...twiddling their thumbs and going:

161
00:12:10,953 --> 00:12:13,989
- Dad! The plan.
- I'm getting to that.

162
00:12:14,206 --> 00:12:16,578
So anyway, they're going:

163
00:12:22,756 --> 00:12:24,665
- Dad!
- So anyway, we get in our car...

164
00:12:24,842 --> 00:12:29,634
...and take the bridge out of town.
While all the while, they're still going:

165
00:12:32,516 --> 00:12:35,540
Dad, they're firing the rocket!

166
00:12:37,229 --> 00:12:38,889
All right!

167
00:12:53,746 --> 00:12:56,284
It blew up the bridge! We're doomed!

168
00:12:56,457 --> 00:12:59,707
It's times like this
I wish I were a religious man.

169
00:12:59,877 --> 00:13:05,370
It's all over, people!
We don't have a prayer!

170
00:13:16,769 --> 00:13:19,805
And like Icarus,
the rocket foolishly soared too high...

171
00:13:21,982 --> 00:13:23,939
...and lost control of its
servo-guidance mechanism...

172
00:13:24,109 --> 00:13:26,268
...leaving us with some...

173
00:13:26,445 --> 00:13:28,272
...six hours to live.

174
00:13:28,489 --> 00:13:32,569
So let's go live now to the charred
remains of the only bridge out of town...

175
00:13:32,743 --> 00:13:35,448
...with Arnie Pie
and "Arnie in the Sky."

176
00:13:35,621 --> 00:13:39,321
With the bridge gone and the airport
on the other side of the bridge...

177
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:43,340
...a number of citizens are attempting
to jump the gorge with their cars.

178
00:13:43,253 --> 00:13:45,875
It's a silent testament
to the never-give-up...

179
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,215
...and never-think-things-out
spirit of our citizens.

180
00:13:49,426 --> 00:13:52,795
With our annihilation imminent, our
government has snapped into action.

181
00:13:52,971 --> 00:13:56,554
We go live now via satellite to the
floor of the United States Congress.

182
00:13:59,645 --> 00:14:02,646
Then it is unanimous.
We are going to approve the bill...

183
00:14:02,815 --> 00:14:05,222
...to evacuate
the town of Springfield...

184
00:14:05,401 --> 00:14:07,607
...in the great state of...
- Wait a second.

185
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:09,646
I wanna tack on a rider to that bill.

186
00:14:09,822 --> 00:14:13,107
Thirty million dollars of taxpayer money
to support the perverted arts.

187
00:14:13,325 --> 00:14:18,664
All in favor of the amended
Springfield/pervert bill?

188
00:14:19,915 --> 00:14:21,243
Bill defeated.

189
00:14:21,542 --> 00:14:26,204
I've said it before and I'll say it again,
democracy simply doesn't work.

190
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:29,297
Now, over the years a newsman
learns a number of things...

191
00:14:29,466 --> 00:14:32,669
...that for one reason or another
he just cannot report.

192
00:14:32,845 --> 00:14:35,300
It doesn't seem to matter now, so...

193
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:37,469
The following people are gay.

194
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:41,600
- Turn it off.
- Just a second.

195
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:48,309
What's everyone so worked up about?
So there's a comet.

196
00:14:48,485 --> 00:14:51,689
Big deal. It'll burn up in our atmosphere
and what's ever left...

197
00:14:51,864 --> 00:14:54,220
...will be no bigger
than a Chihuahua's head.

198
00:14:54,199 --> 00:14:57,533
- Wow, Dad. Maybe you're right.
- Of course I'm right.

199
00:14:57,703 --> 00:15:01,535
If I'm not, may we all be horribly crushed
from above somehow.

200
00:15:02,666 --> 00:15:07,412
Okay, if you're that worried about it,
let's go down to the bomb shelter.

201
00:15:07,588 --> 00:15:08,999
We have a bomb shelter?

202
00:15:09,173 --> 00:15:12,257
Homer Simpson
takes care of his family.

203
00:15:13,802 --> 00:15:16,910
Flanders, open up!

204
00:15:16,889 --> 00:15:19,558
Hidy-ho-a-roonie, neighbor.
What can I do you for?

205
00:15:19,725 --> 00:15:22,430
Get out of there.
My family needs your bomb shelter.

206
00:15:22,603 --> 00:15:25,272
- Homer.
- I kind of figured this might happen.

207
00:15:25,481 --> 00:15:27,972
So I built the shelter big enough
for both families.

208
00:15:28,192 --> 00:15:31,193
- No deal. Out.
- Get in the shelter, Homer.

209
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:59,305
- One more hour.
- An hour?

210
00:15:59,515 --> 00:16:03,762
I can't wait another hour.
What's keeping that stupid comet?

211
00:16:04,186 --> 00:16:05,894
There it is.

212
00:16:08,774 --> 00:16:11,526
Well, howdily-doodily, neighbors.

213
00:16:11,694 --> 00:16:14,185
Shouldn't you be
in your shelterinies by now?

214
00:16:14,363 --> 00:16:17,530
We haven't got shelterinies.
We want in yours.

215
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:20,571
Well, sorry. Shelter's kind of full.

216
00:16:20,786 --> 00:16:22,161
Really?

217
00:16:22,579 --> 00:16:25,746
Well, we'll just go off someplace
and die then. Thanks.

218
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:31,876
Wait. You know, I may regret
this when our air runs out...

219
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:35,748
...and we can't whistle or stay alive,
but, oh, what the hey.

220
00:16:37,928 --> 00:16:39,755
All right.

221
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:44,134
I can't get the...

222
00:16:44,351 --> 00:16:47,554
I can't get the door closed.
Somebody's gonna have to get out.

223
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:50,399
I'd get out,
but I don't know where I am.

224
00:16:50,566 --> 00:16:53,732
- Hey, somebody's touching me.
- I am.

225
00:16:53,902 --> 00:16:55,610
- Oh, okay.
- Okay, okay.

226
00:16:55,779 --> 00:16:59,650
Let's figure out who should stay.
Let's see.

227
00:16:59,241 --> 00:17:02,906
In the world of the future,
we'll need laughter, so I'm in.

228
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:07,123
And it'll need somebody
to dispense drinks, i.e. Me.

229
00:17:07,291 --> 00:17:11,390
And someone will have to run the power.
You can do that, Homer.

230
00:17:11,211 --> 00:17:14,545
Yeah. I can do that.

231
00:17:17,343 --> 00:17:19,419
Okay, let's start again.

232
00:17:19,636 --> 00:17:22,554
We'll need laughter,
religious enlightenment, gossip.

233
00:17:22,723 --> 00:17:24,881
- That's Mrs. Lovejoy.
- Wait a minute.

234
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:28,884
We all know the one thing we won't
need in the future: Left-handed stores.

235
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:30,521
That's you, Flanders!

236
00:17:31,899 --> 00:17:36,193
I'm terribly sorry.
Flanders is the only useless person here.

237
00:17:36,362 --> 00:17:38,900
If anyone dies, it should be him.

238
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:41,777
I'm sorry. Please forgive me.

239
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:45,284
So let's kick Flanders out.
Sorry.

240
00:17:45,871 --> 00:17:48,290
Well, sir, sounds fair.

241
00:17:48,207 --> 00:17:51,410
Toodle-loo, everybody.
I'll scream when the comet gets here.

242
00:17:51,585 --> 00:17:54,586
- Oh, I'm coming with you, Neddie.
- No, sweetheart.

243
00:17:54,755 --> 00:17:58,539
- You... You stay here, because...
- Okay.

244
00:17:59,176 --> 00:18:01,963
I might go mad with fear out there,
so, Todd...

245
00:18:02,137 --> 00:18:06,716
...I want you to shoot Daddy
if he tries to get back in.

246
00:18:06,892 --> 00:18:09,763
- Okay, Dad.
- Okay.

247
00:18:27,121 --> 00:18:28,829
Hey, I got an idea.

248
00:18:28,998 --> 00:18:31,489
We can play a game to pass the time.

249
00:18:31,667 --> 00:18:37,207
I'll make the sound of a barnyard animal,
and you all try to guess what it is.

250
00:18:41,844 --> 00:18:43,504
- It's a pig.
- It's a cow, man.

251
00:18:43,721 --> 00:18:45,630
- It's a pony.
- No, it's a goat.

252
00:18:45,806 --> 00:18:48,641
- You know, one of them lady goats.
- There are no lady goats.

253
00:18:48,809 --> 00:18:51,980
- A lady goat is a sheep.
- I believe she's right.

254
00:18:51,312 --> 00:18:53,470
- You're crazy.
- What's it to you?

255
00:18:53,647 --> 00:18:55,854
- What's it to me?
- Hey, it's a pony!

256
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:58,729
- Shut up!
- Doesn't anybody care that I'm hungry?

257
00:18:58,902 --> 00:19:02,770
Stop it, stop it. Can't you see
this barnyard-noise guessing game...

258
00:19:02,948 --> 00:19:05,320
...is tearing us apart?

259
00:19:12,291 --> 00:19:14,829
Say, Moe, was it a duck?

260
00:19:16,629 --> 00:19:18,835
I don't like it...

261
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:23,834
No! No! Shut up! Shut up!
Stop it! Stop it!

262
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:25,635
I can't take this anymore.

263
00:19:25,804 --> 00:19:29,900
I can't let that brave man
out there die alone.

264
00:19:29,266 --> 00:19:32,530
I'm surprised and disgusted
by all of you.

265
00:19:32,353 --> 00:19:34,179
Especially his children.

266
00:19:34,355 --> 00:19:36,312
I'm going out there.

267
00:19:37,524 --> 00:19:39,232
And it was a baby ox.

268
00:19:39,401 --> 00:19:41,109
- He's right, you know.
- About the ox?

269
00:19:41,278 --> 00:19:45,905
About everything, damn it!
Hey, Homer, wait up. I wanna die too.

270
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,670
- If you are going, I am going.
- Me too.

271
00:19:48,243 --> 00:19:50,781
- Me too.
- I'm out of here. Make way.

272
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:54,367
Radio reception in there sucked.

273
00:20:33,455 --> 00:20:35,330
Run!

274
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:43,622
- Look!
- It's breaking up!

275
00:20:57,104 --> 00:21:00,555
- Cool.
- We're saved!

276
00:21:02,318 --> 00:21:06,446
Sure makes you appreciate
the preciousness of life.

277
00:21:07,698 --> 00:21:11,992
Let's go burn down the observatory
so this'll never happen again.

278
00:21:14,121 --> 00:21:18,710
I can't believe that extra-thick layer
of pollution that I've picketed against...

279
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:21,204
...is what burned up the comet.
- What's really amazing...

280
00:21:21,378 --> 00:21:25,791
...is that this is exactly what Dad
said would happen.

281
00:21:25,966 --> 00:21:28,600
Yeah. Dad was right.

282
00:21:28,177 --> 00:21:31,842
I know, kids. I'm scared too.
