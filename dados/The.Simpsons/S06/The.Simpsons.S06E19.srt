1
00:00:06,465 --> 00:00:08,008
Lisa's Wedding

2
00:00:43,168 --> 00:00:46,421
Zounds! I did thee mightily smitely.

3
00:00:48,632 --> 00:00:51,927
"Zounds" is a Renaissance English word, 
 short for "God's wounds"...

4
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:54,388
...but "smitely," that's pure Flanders.

5
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:56,890
Please call a doctor.

6
00:00:57,766 --> 00:01:03,939
- These Renaissance fairs are so boring. 
 - Oh, really? Did you see the loom?

7
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:06,483
I took loom in high school.

8
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:21,999
Yon meat 'tis sweet 
 as summer's wafting breeze.

9
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:24,793
- Can I have some? 
 - Mine ears are open to the pleas...

10
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,879
...of those who speak ye old English.

11
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:30,591
Sweet maiden of the spit, grant now 
 my boon, that I might sup...

12
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,510
...upon suckling pig this noon. 
 - Whatever.

13
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:37,764
I've eaten eight different meats. 
 I'm a true Renaissance man.

14
00:01:39,683 --> 00:01:44,021
I'll go to the first-aid tent and tell them 
 to plug in ye old stomach pump.

15
00:01:47,691 --> 00:01:50,110
Alight your gaze 
 on yonder fabled beasts of yore.

16
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:56,742
Behold the rarest of the rare...

17
00:01:56,909 --> 00:02:01,455
...the mythological two-headed hound, 
 born with only one head.

18
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:05,959
And here, out of the mists of history, 
 the legendary esquilax:

19
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:11,298
A horse with the head of a rabbit 
 and the body of a rabbit.

20
00:02:13,008 --> 00:02:14,301
It's galloping away.

21
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:16,261
Here, bunny-bunny. Here, bunny.

22
00:02:16,428 --> 00:02:17,721
Here, "esquilax."

23
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:32,903
I've been waiting for you, Lisa.

24
00:02:33,362 --> 00:02:35,948
- How did you know my name? 
 - Your nametag.

25
00:02:38,367 --> 00:02:40,452
Would you like to know your future?

26
00:02:40,911 --> 00:02:43,789
Sorry, I don't believe in fortunetelling. 
 I should go.

27
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:46,834
What's your hurry? Bart, Maggie 
 and Marge are at the joust.

28
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,419
And Homer is heckling 
 the puppet show.

29
00:02:49,628 --> 00:02:52,631
Wow, you can see into the present.

30
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,843
Now we'll see what the future holds.

31
00:02:57,803 --> 00:02:59,888
- The death card? 
 - No, that's good.

32
00:03:00,055 --> 00:03:03,183
It means transition, change.

33
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:05,894
That's cute.

34
00:03:06,061 --> 00:03:07,312
The happy squirrel.

35
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:08,981
- That's bad? 
 - Possibly.

36
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:11,567
The cards are vague and mysterious.

37
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:15,362
They seem to be revealing 
 the story of your first love.

38
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:17,072
Do you want me to continue?

39
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:20,367
- Guess so. 
 - It's...

40
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:23,120
It's coming to me. Yes.

41
00:03:23,287 --> 00:03:27,249
I see an eastern university 
 in the year 2010.

42
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:31,170
The world has become 
 a very different place.

43
00:03:42,598 --> 00:03:44,808
I can't wait to see that play.

44
00:03:56,278 --> 00:03:58,405
- Hey, watch it. 
 - Watch it.

45
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:03,410
That man is instantly the most 
 annoying person I've ever met.

46
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:06,205
A soy-based snack 
 will calm me down.

47
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:20,010
Him again.

48
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:30,812
Hello. I need Ecosystem of the Marsh 
 by Thompson.

49
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:34,358
The last copy was just signed out by...

50
00:04:34,525 --> 00:04:36,151
...Hugh Parkfield.

51
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,903
Oh, there he is.

52
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:40,030
No. It couldn't be.

53
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:44,910
Thanks for holding my book 
 while I tied my shoe.

54
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:48,789
That's the book I need. 
 You'll probably take forever with it too.

55
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:51,458
- I read faster. 
 - I read at a 78th-grade level.

56
00:04:51,667 --> 00:04:53,335
Right here.

57
00:04:57,256 --> 00:05:00,217
- Finished this page? 
 - Ages ago.

58
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:02,302
- I'll get the dictionary. 
 - Why?

59
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:05,389
- You'll see. "Stochastic." 
 - Pertaining to a process...

60
00:05:05,556 --> 00:05:09,226
...involving a randomly determined 
 sequence of observations.

61
00:05:13,605 --> 00:05:16,859
First, they hate each other. 
 All of a sudden, they love each other.

62
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:20,821
- Oh, it doesn't make any sense to me. 
 - Of course not. You're a robot.

63
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:34,084
I never met anyone who so understood 
 the magic of Jim Carrey.

64
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:37,838
He can make you laugh with no more 
 than a frantic flailing of his limbs.

65
00:05:39,214 --> 00:05:41,133
I can't believe how much 
 we have in common.

66
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:45,012
We're studying the environment, we're 
 utterly humorless about vegetarianism.

67
00:05:45,179 --> 00:05:46,638
And we both love the Rolling Stones.

68
00:05:48,807 --> 00:05:50,642
Yes. Not for their music 
 but for their tireless efforts...

69
00:05:50,809 --> 00:05:52,603
...to preserve historic buildings.

70
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:54,855
Lisa, I can't bear being apart 
 all summer.

71
00:05:55,022 --> 00:05:56,607
Come with me to Parkfield Manor.

72
00:05:56,773 --> 00:06:00,319
I'd love to. Can we get vegetarian meals 
 at your parents' house?

73
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:02,279
- Yes, we can, Lisa. 
 - That is good.

74
00:06:02,446 --> 00:06:05,282
- Because eating animals is wrong. 
 - So very wrong.

75
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:09,703
- When will the world learn? 
 - I don't know. I just don't know.

76
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:13,499
I love these new planes.

77
00:06:13,665 --> 00:06:17,044
Yes. It's a good thing they re-evaluated 
 those wacky old designs.

78
00:06:29,473 --> 00:06:32,017
- Beautiful dinnerware, Mrs. Parkfield. 
 - Thank you.

79
00:06:32,184 --> 00:06:34,561
They were made 
 for the finest family in Britain.

80
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:37,397
I don't know 
 how we ended up with them.

81
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:41,610
Should I laugh? Was that dry 
 British wit or subtle self-pity?

82
00:06:41,777 --> 00:06:43,612
They're staring at me. Better respond.

83
00:06:46,323 --> 00:06:49,910
It's good to hear 
 a boisterous American laugh.

84
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:53,872
And I love that painting. Judging 
 by the clothes, I'd say 17th century.

85
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:56,583
Actually, Lisa, it's just Uncle Eldred.

86
00:06:56,792 --> 00:07:01,046
I get me brain medicines 
 from the National Health.

87
00:07:02,631 --> 00:07:06,468
This place is so enchanting, Hugh. 
 I love it here.

88
00:07:06,718 --> 00:07:08,846
I wanted this to be perfect for you.

89
00:07:09,012 --> 00:07:11,557
I know you Americans 
 like everything to be...

90
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:13,517
...fireworks.

91
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:27,281
Oh, blast. Go to plan B.

92
00:07:31,034 --> 00:07:33,078
Yes, I will.

93
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:37,916
Isn't it wonderful?

94
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:43,088
Master Hugh has found a true love.

95
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:56,476
- Hi, Mom. 
 - Lisa. Hello.

96
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:59,897
How are you doing in England? 
 Remember, an elevator is a "lift"...

97
00:08:00,063 --> 00:08:03,901
...a mile is called a "kilometer," 
 and botulism is "steak-and-kidney pie."

98
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:06,153
Guess what. 
 Hugh and I are getting married.

99
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:10,574
All right! Lisa, that's wonderful.

100
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:14,411
If only your father was still with us.

101
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,914
But he left for work a few minutes ago.

102
00:08:17,164 --> 00:08:21,543
Remember we'd always plan my dream 
 wedding, and you always promised...

103
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:25,839
...to, you know, well, 
 keep Dad from ruining it?

104
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:29,885
Oh, don 't worry, honey. 
 I guarantee your father will behave.

105
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:32,638
- Mom, it's a Picturephone. 
 - Oh, this? This?

106
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:35,224
Oh, no. I just got 
 a touch of the rheumatiz.

107
00:08:36,934 --> 00:08:37,976
Mom, Picturephone.

108
00:08:40,229 --> 00:08:42,606
Hi, Mom. 
 Oh, that's great news about Lisa.

109
00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:44,691
Well, listen, I better get back to work.

110
00:08:46,652 --> 00:08:49,321
They're finally paying me for this.

111
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:54,535
Oh, yeah.

112
00:09:03,168 --> 00:09:06,004
Yes, but the international market 
 is my focus.

113
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:09,591
Oh, Marge, that's great news.

114
00:09:09,842 --> 00:09:12,261
Hey, hey, there 
 with the personal calls, Simpson.

115
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:16,139
But, Mr. Milhouse, 
 my little girl's getting married.

116
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:17,724
Lisa?

117
00:09:18,809 --> 00:09:20,686
My one true love.

118
00:09:22,104 --> 00:09:25,524
It's not you, Milhouse. 
 I just don't plan to ever get married.

119
00:09:30,529 --> 00:09:35,200
I think I'll write your performance 
 evaluation now, Simpson.

120
00:09:40,539 --> 00:09:43,000
I gotta call everyone 
 and tell them the good news.

121
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,585
What the...?

122
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:47,171
Maggie, I need to use the phone.

123
00:09:49,006 --> 00:09:50,883
Will that girl ever shut up?

124
00:09:51,133 --> 00:09:54,219
I'll plan everything. 
 We can have the reception at Moe's.

125
00:09:54,428 --> 00:09:57,764
Why not have the whole wedding there. 
 We'll do it on a Monday morning.

126
00:09:57,973 --> 00:10:00,809
- There'll be fewer drunks. 
 - Don't take this personally.

127
00:10:01,018 --> 00:10:04,313
I've obtained a court order to prevent 
 you from planning this wedding.

128
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:05,814
"Whereas Homer Simpson..."

129
00:10:06,023 --> 00:10:08,817
Well, these seem to be in order. 
 I'll be in the hammock.

130
00:10:11,737 --> 00:10:14,114
"Mr. Smithers plus guest."

131
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:16,909
There's only one person 
 I'd wanna bring.

132
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:24,500
Oh, Mr. Burns, we'll thaw you out 
 the second they discover the cure...

133
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:27,419
...for 17 stab wounds in the back. 
 How we doing, boys?

134
00:10:27,628 --> 00:10:29,505
Well, we're up to 15.

135
00:10:39,932 --> 00:10:44,102
If you have three Pepsis and drink one, 
 how much more refreshed are you?

136
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:46,396
The redhead in 
 the Chicago school system.

137
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:48,524
- Pepsi? 
 - Partial credit.

138
00:10:50,484 --> 00:10:54,363
We're invited to the wedding of our 
 only graduate to read at an adult level.

139
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:55,989
It must be Lisa Simpson.

140
00:10:56,198 --> 00:10:59,785
Of course, Martin Prince perished 
 in that science-fair explosion.

141
00:11:00,661 --> 00:11:03,413
Not quite perished, my lady love.

142
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:06,416
Although some days I wish I had.

143
00:11:20,556 --> 00:11:23,141
Hey, I remember you. 
 Mayor Quimby, right?

144
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:27,229
No. Look at this license. 
 I'm Mohamed Jafar.

145
00:11:27,396 --> 00:11:31,024
Quimby, after this fare, get your 
 indicted ass to the convention center.

146
00:11:31,233 --> 00:11:33,443
I cut the ribbon 
 at that convention center.

147
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:40,701
Just a couple more blocks 
 to my house.

148
00:11:43,078 --> 00:11:46,165
Darling, don't worry. I'm sure 
 I'll get along with your family.

149
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:47,833
You prepared me for the worst.

150
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,169
As long as they're not 
 squatting in a ditch...

151
00:11:50,335 --> 00:11:52,379
...poking berries up their noses.

152
00:11:52,546 --> 00:11:54,506
And if they are?

153
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:57,718
Here they come. Raise the flag.

154
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:03,932
- Oh, Lisa. 
 - Yo, Hugh.

155
00:12:04,141 --> 00:12:06,518
Here's a little bit of U.S. Hospitality.

156
00:12:06,685 --> 00:12:08,604
What do you think of that?

157
00:12:10,939 --> 00:12:12,482
Dad!

158
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:16,028
Now throw compost on it.

159
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:22,159
Enjoy.

160
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:24,995
Still warm.

161
00:12:32,461 --> 00:12:35,631
You can be the first to try out 
 the new guest bedroom I built.

162
00:12:35,797 --> 00:12:40,010
If the building inspector comes by, 
 it's not a room, it's a window box.

163
00:12:41,637 --> 00:12:42,971
Oh, Hugh, thank you.

164
00:12:43,138 --> 00:12:45,849
You've been just wonderful 
 through this entire ordeal.

165
00:12:46,058 --> 00:12:49,394
Lisa, I love you so much. 
 I'm willing to go through anything.

166
00:12:51,563 --> 00:12:55,025
- Are you okay? 
 - I'm fine, Lisa.

167
00:12:55,234 --> 00:12:57,653
Fortunately, the compost heap 
 broke my fall.

168
00:12:57,819 --> 00:12:59,530
Be a dear, run a bath.

169
00:13:03,408 --> 00:13:06,203
Homer, Bart, Maggie, 
 company eating rules.

170
00:13:06,995 --> 00:13:08,330
Oh, right.

171
00:13:10,415 --> 00:13:14,378
Anyway, Hugh, there's more to my life 
 than just the wrecking ball.

172
00:13:14,545 --> 00:13:16,672
I also crush cars into cubes.

173
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:19,258
On the side, 
 I promote local tough-man contests.

174
00:13:19,424 --> 00:13:22,427
I'm getting out all my aggression 
 till I go to law school.

175
00:13:22,636 --> 00:13:25,514
So, Hugh, have you heard 
 all the latest American jokes?

176
00:13:25,681 --> 00:13:28,058
Here's a good one. Pull my finger.

177
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,811
Yes, we have that one in England too.

178
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:32,688
I said, pull my finger.

179
00:13:32,896 --> 00:13:35,566
Mom, we've got my wedding-dress 
 fitting this afternoon.

180
00:13:35,732 --> 00:13:38,569
Maggie, if you're not doing anything, 
 why don't you come.

181
00:13:38,777 --> 00:13:40,821
Maggie, don't talk 
 with your mouth full.

182
00:13:41,405 --> 00:13:43,574
Me and Bart will take Hugh 
 out this afternoon.

183
00:13:43,782 --> 00:13:45,993
Hugh should take it easy 
 because of his fall.

184
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:48,954
The only thing bruised in that fall 
 was my spine.

185
00:13:49,121 --> 00:13:50,956
- I'll be delighted. 
 - Great.

186
00:13:51,123 --> 00:13:53,625
- There's only one thing I ask in return. 
 - Certainly.

187
00:13:53,792 --> 00:13:54,877
Pull my finger.

188
00:13:55,502 --> 00:13:58,839
So this driving on the left makes you 
 feel more at home, huh, Hugh?

189
00:14:02,843 --> 00:14:05,971
And tonight, the following 
 celebrities have been arrested:

190
00:14:06,138 --> 00:14:08,348
Heather Locklear Fortensky 
 remains at large.

191
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:12,811
Remember, if you see any celebrities, 
 consider them dangerous.

192
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,980
You know, I rather like this pub.

193
00:14:15,189 --> 00:14:17,191
An English boy, eh?

194
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:19,651
You know, 
 we saved your ass in World War II.

195
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,904
Well, we saved your ass 
 in World War III.

196
00:14:22,112 --> 00:14:25,616
- That's true. 
 - There's something I want you to have.

197
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:28,911
My dad gave me his cuff links to wear 
 on the day I married Marge.

198
00:14:29,077 --> 00:14:32,873
They brought us good luck. 
 I couldn't imagine a happier marriage.

199
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,626
We don't have many traditions 
 in our family.

200
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:40,464
But it would mean a lot to me 
 if you kept this one alive.

201
00:14:40,672 --> 00:14:42,424
Well, I'd be honored...

202
00:14:42,925 --> 00:14:46,720
...to wear those things.

203
00:14:51,308 --> 00:14:53,227
Hey, watch those virtual darts.

204
00:14:53,435 --> 00:14:55,771
I'm trying to play virtual pool.

205
00:14:58,899 --> 00:15:00,817
Hey, hey. No fighting in my bar.

206
00:15:05,113 --> 00:15:08,992
You know, Fox turned into 
 a hardcore-sex channel so gradually...

207
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:10,953
...I didn't even notice.

208
00:15:11,829 --> 00:15:15,457
It's so great to have the whole family 
 together under one roof.

209
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:17,668
I never realized how much I missed it.

210
00:15:17,835 --> 00:15:23,632
Listen to the murmurs in the next room. 
 The house is full of life again.

211
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:26,093
Keep it down in there!

212
00:15:26,301 --> 00:15:28,220
All right, Dad.

213
00:15:28,387 --> 00:15:31,056
I'm sorry I left you alone 
 with Homer and Bart.

214
00:15:31,223 --> 00:15:33,684
No, no, honey. We had a fine time.

215
00:15:33,892 --> 00:15:36,770
- How'd you get that gash? 
 - When we hid in the Dumpster...

216
00:15:36,937 --> 00:15:40,691
...after the fire alarm went off 
 in the pornographic-magazine warehouse.

217
00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:43,026
You are so good 
 to put up with all of this.

218
00:15:43,193 --> 00:15:45,445
Oh, don't be silly, Lisa.

219
00:15:45,612 --> 00:15:47,990
Everything's fine. Really.

220
00:15:48,156 --> 00:15:51,660
Now, go to sleep. We have a big day 
 ahead of us tomorrow.

221
00:15:51,827 --> 00:15:54,913
A big, long day.

222
00:16:02,129 --> 00:16:05,007
Lisa, I can't believe 
 it's your wedding day already.

223
00:16:05,215 --> 00:16:09,344
Mom, I feel kind of funny wearing white. 
 I mean, Milhouse.

224
00:16:09,553 --> 00:16:10,929
Oh, Milhouse doesn't count.

225
00:16:15,225 --> 00:16:18,437
Okay, I've got something old, 
 that's my pearl necklace.

226
00:16:18,604 --> 00:16:20,355
Something new is the wedding dress.

227
00:16:20,522 --> 00:16:23,692
Something borrowed is this antique 
 brooch from Hugh's mother.

228
00:16:23,901 --> 00:16:25,611
Now I just need something blue.

229
00:16:26,695 --> 00:16:30,574
- Here. 
 - Oh, Mom, thanks.

230
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:45,339
Wow, Lisa. Looking at you makes me 
 wanna get married for a third time.

231
00:16:45,506 --> 00:16:48,467
I met a really nice exotic dancer 
 at Hugh's bachelor party.

232
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:52,012
- Hugh didn't have a bachelor party. 
 - We had one in his honor.

233
00:16:52,804 --> 00:16:54,681
I had one in his honor.

234
00:16:56,391 --> 00:16:57,684
I went to a strip club.

235
00:16:57,893 --> 00:17:01,021
Well, here goes nothing.

236
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:05,901
Mum, Dad...

237
00:17:06,068 --> 00:17:07,694
...meet Homer Simpson.

238
00:17:07,861 --> 00:17:09,488
- How do you do? 
 - Hey. How are you?

239
00:17:09,655 --> 00:17:11,406
Nice to meet you.

240
00:17:13,951 --> 00:17:15,953
You know what's great 
 about you English?

241
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:19,665
Octopussy. Man, I must have 
 seen that movie...

242
00:17:19,832 --> 00:17:20,958
...twice.

243
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:25,671
Yes. Yes. That's not too bad.

244
00:17:28,757 --> 00:17:31,093
Hey, Krabappel, get in the way 
 of that bouquet...

245
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:33,595
...I'll stuff that sunhat 
 down your neck.

246
00:17:35,055 --> 00:17:38,058
Smithers, take me home. 
 I'm not fully defrosted.

247
00:17:38,225 --> 00:17:40,686
Nonsense. Just sit down 
 and rest for a moment.

248
00:17:40,894 --> 00:17:42,688
There you go.

249
00:17:43,355 --> 00:17:46,149
Oh, no. We've got 
 a little situation here.

250
00:17:46,358 --> 00:17:48,819
I can't feel anything 
 below my cummerbund.

251
00:17:50,779 --> 00:17:53,448
- Hi, Dad. 
 - You look great, sweetheart.

252
00:17:53,615 --> 00:17:56,994
- Thanks. 
 - Little Lisa. Lisa Simpson.

253
00:17:57,161 --> 00:18:00,706
I always felt you were the best thing 
 my name ever got attached to.

254
00:18:00,873 --> 00:18:04,918
Since you learned to pin your own 
 diapers, you've been smarter than me.

255
00:18:05,127 --> 00:18:07,754
- Oh, Dad. 
 - No, no. Let me finish.

256
00:18:07,963 --> 00:18:10,465
I want you to know 
 I've always been proud of you.

257
00:18:10,632 --> 00:18:13,844
You're my greatest accomplishment, 
 and you did it all yourself.

258
00:18:14,011 --> 00:18:16,305
You helped me understand 
 my own wife better...

259
00:18:16,471 --> 00:18:20,184
...and taught me to be a better person. 
 But you're also my daughter.

260
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:23,187
I don't think anybody could've had 
 a better daughter...

261
00:18:23,395 --> 00:18:26,607
- Dad, you're babbling. 
 - See? You're still helping me.

262
00:18:28,901 --> 00:18:31,695
Hey, Dad, did you forget to give 
 those cuff links to Hugh?

263
00:18:33,071 --> 00:18:34,364
- No. 
 - Well?

264
00:18:34,531 --> 00:18:36,116
I found them on the nightstand.

265
00:18:36,283 --> 00:18:38,619
I guess they weren't his cup of tea. 
 Don't worry.

266
00:18:38,785 --> 00:18:40,996
But you've been going on 
 about these all week.

267
00:18:41,163 --> 00:18:43,081
I'm sure he just forgot.

268
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:47,336
Lisa, we're not supposed to see 
 each other before the wedding.

269
00:18:47,503 --> 00:18:50,631
- It's tradition. 
 - What about my family's tradition?

270
00:18:50,797 --> 00:18:54,801
Surely you don't want me to wear those 
 in front of my parents and their friends.

271
00:18:54,968 --> 00:18:58,388
- But you promised my dad you would. 
 - I was just humoring him.

272
00:18:58,555 --> 00:19:01,517
- Actually, he frightens me a bit. 
 - I know they look silly...

273
00:19:01,683 --> 00:19:03,852
...but his feelings will be hurt.

274
00:19:04,061 --> 00:19:05,729
Fine.

275
00:19:05,896 --> 00:19:09,233
I must say, you were right. 
 This has been quite trying.

276
00:19:09,441 --> 00:19:12,402
I've attempted to enjoy your family 
 on a personal level...

277
00:19:12,569 --> 00:19:16,657
...on an ironic level, as a novelty, 
 as camp, as kitsch...

278
00:19:16,823 --> 00:19:19,660
...as cautionary example. 
 Nothing works.

279
00:19:19,827 --> 00:19:23,163
When we get back to England, 
 we won't have to deal with them.

280
00:19:23,372 --> 00:19:25,374
You saying we won't 
 see my family again?

281
00:19:25,582 --> 00:19:28,126
Your mother will come 
 when the children are born.

282
00:19:28,293 --> 00:19:31,630
I can't believe I'm hearing this. 
 I don't wanna cut my family out.

283
00:19:31,797 --> 00:19:34,800
Really? Lisa, you're better 
 than this place.

284
00:19:34,967 --> 00:19:37,177
You're like a flower 
 that grew out of dirt.

285
00:19:37,636 --> 00:19:40,013
- That's a horrible thing to say. 
 - Oh, come on.

286
00:19:40,222 --> 00:19:44,685
- You complain more than anyone. 
 - Maybe, but I still love them.

287
00:19:44,893 --> 00:19:48,480
And I don't think you understand that.

288
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:55,654
And now, to sing "Amazing Grace"...

289
00:19:55,863 --> 00:19:58,073
...Miss Maggie Simpson.

290
00:19:58,907 --> 00:20:01,702
She's quite a hellion, 
 but does have an incredible voice.

291
00:20:04,121 --> 00:20:06,874
Stop everything. 
 The wedding has been called off.

292
00:20:13,338 --> 00:20:15,966
This is very sad news.

293
00:20:16,175 --> 00:20:20,637
It never would've happened if the 
 wedding was in the church with God...

294
00:20:20,846 --> 00:20:24,600
...instead of out here 
 in the cheap showiness of nature.

295
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:26,810
Who wants cake?

296
00:20:43,452 --> 00:20:47,831
The next day, Hugh goes back to 
 England, and you never see him again.

297
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:52,336
Now that I know, isn't there any way 
 to change the future?

298
00:20:52,544 --> 00:20:55,005
No. But try to look surprised.

299
00:20:55,255 --> 00:20:57,299
You said you'd tell me 
 about my true love.

300
00:20:57,508 --> 00:20:59,635
Oh, you'll have a true love.

301
00:20:59,885 --> 00:21:02,387
But I specialize in foretelling 
 the relationships...

302
00:21:02,596 --> 00:21:04,473
...where you get jerked around.

303
00:21:17,861 --> 00:21:20,948
Lisa, where were you? 
 You missed the most incredible thing.

00:21:21,156 --> 00:21:24,993
- Hi, Dad. 
 - I ate seven pounds of fudge.

305
00:21:25,828 --> 00:21:28,205
The man at the stand said 
 it was a record.

306
00:21:28,413 --> 00:21:29,706
What else did you do, Dad?

307
00:21:29,915 --> 00:21:33,460
I rode the tea cups. Then I got 
 a little sick, and I had to sit down.

308
00:21:33,669 --> 00:21:35,754
But then I rode them again.
