00:00:38,247 --> 00:00:41,533
Well, you're certainly doing your
job today, Mr. Sun.

2
00:00:43,419 --> 00:00:45,210
Oh, rats.

3
00:00:47,715 --> 00:00:49,709
And here we have
the world-famous Beatles...

4
00:00:49,884 --> 00:00:53,416
...exactly as they looked performing
on The Ed Sullivan Show.

5
00:00:54,762 --> 00:00:57,170
I hardly think it's fair to be
charged full price.

6
00:00:57,349 --> 00:01:00,350
I'm up to my knees
in the original cast of M* A * S *H.

7
00:01:10,988 --> 00:01:15,947
- Homer, my hat goes off to you.
- It's cool in here, boy.

8
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:19,945
For the rest of the summer,
we can live inside the refrigerator.

9
00:01:21,166 --> 00:01:23,998
Homer, the fridge wasn't meant
to be used this way.

10
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:28,249
Although I must say,
it's certainly refreshing.

11
00:01:34,762 --> 00:01:37,632
I got the idea when I noticed
the refrigerator was cold.

12
00:01:38,099 --> 00:01:40,007
Won't this overload the motor?

13
00:01:45,481 --> 00:01:47,771
Marge, can you set the oven to cold?

14
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:03,406
Ice cream! Ice cream!

15
00:02:06,669 --> 00:02:11,745
I'm all out of ice cream! It's true,
you know. Ice cream! Ice cream!

16
00:02:12,133 --> 00:02:13,675
Fresh out of ice cream!

17
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:21,764
Chili! Red-hot, Texas-style chili!

18
00:02:21,935 --> 00:02:27,936
And we got ginger ale.
Boiling hot, Texas-style ginger ale!

19
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:29,766
Texas!

20
00:02:29,942 --> 00:02:35,018
Face it, Bart. Our salvation isn't gonna
roll by on the back of some stupid truck.

21
00:02:40,452 --> 00:02:42,030
I gotta replace that window.

22
00:02:42,246 --> 00:02:43,871
- Pool-mobile?
- Pool-mobile?

23
00:02:50,589 --> 00:02:54,085
Look, Lis, I snatched five
bathing suits. All Martin's.

24
00:02:54,298 --> 00:02:57,419
Take your best shot.
I'm wearing 17 layers.

25
00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:03,966
I brought this on myself.

26
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:08,855
Okay, little dudes, time's up.
Everybody out!

27
00:03:12,444 --> 00:03:14,270
- Time's up?
- So long, Lis.

28
00:03:14,446 --> 00:03:17,232
I'm gonna stow away underwater
and go where the pool goes.

29
00:03:17,407 --> 00:03:18,949
Have a good life.

30
00:03:24,202 --> 00:03:27,205
Sorry, Bart, dude. We gotta fill
this thing with Epsom salts...

31
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:31,454
...and jam over to the old folks' home.
- Oh, well. Same time tomorrow, Otto?

32
00:03:31,837 --> 00:03:35,704
No way, man. One day of summer's
all we're budgeted for.

33
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:38,623
I guess it is kind of a tease.

34
00:03:42,014 --> 00:03:43,474
Dad?

35
00:03:44,392 --> 00:03:45,802
Dad?

36
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:49,227
- Dad!
- Yes, Lisa?

37
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:51,431
Dad, as you know,
we've been swimming.

38
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:53,308
And we've developed a taste for it.

39
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:56,560
We both agree that getting
our own pool is the only way to go.

40
00:03:56,777 --> 00:03:59,530
Now, before you respond,
understand that your refusal...

41
00:03:59,698 --> 00:04:01,690
...would result in
months and months of:

42
00:04:01,867 --> 00:04:04,537
- Can we have a pool, Dad?
- Can we have a pool, Dad?

43
00:04:04,704 --> 00:04:07,158
- Can we have a pool, Dad?
- Can we have a pool, Dad?

44
00:04:07,748 --> 00:04:09,077
I understand.

45
00:04:10,001 --> 00:04:14,330
Let us celebrate our new arrangement
with the adding of chocolate to milk.

46
00:04:18,843 --> 00:04:21,880
Over here we have the Hick Tub,
the Insta-Rust.

47
00:04:22,055 --> 00:04:23,595
That's the Lightning Magnet.

48
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:26,088
- That's the Tinkler.
- The Tinkler.

49
00:04:26,264 --> 00:04:28,425
I like the sound of that.
We'll take it.

50
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:32,144
Is it true we should wait at least
an hour after eating before we go in?

51
00:04:32,357 --> 00:04:36,223
Look, question lady, this job is not
what I really do, okay? I play keyboards.

52
00:04:51,667 --> 00:04:54,666
All right, everybody in the pool!

53
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,164
'Tis a fine barn,
but sure 'tis no pool, English.

54
00:05:00,508 --> 00:05:02,586
- Is it a pool yet?
- Yes, Dad.

55
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:05,634
Who could that be?

56
00:05:07,891 --> 00:05:10,597
Hello, Mrs. Bart.

57
00:05:11,229 --> 00:05:12,640
Is your pool ready yet?

58
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:22,446
Bart, are all these children
friends of yours?

59
00:05:22,614 --> 00:05:24,771
Friends and well-wishers, yes.

60
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:26,319
- Hey, Bart.
- Hi, Bart.

61
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:29,280
- Hey, my buddy, Bart.
- Hello, Mrs. Converdale.

62
00:05:34,626 --> 00:05:38,541
People! People, it's time we all
discussed the pool-safety rules.

63
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:40,250
Jump, Bart, jump!

64
00:05:40,633 --> 00:05:42,591
Jump, Bart, jump!

65
00:05:42,844 --> 00:05:44,218
You got it.

66
00:05:44,595 --> 00:05:48,012
Hey, Bart! Your epidermis is showing!

67
00:05:48,182 --> 00:05:49,511
It is?

68
00:05:54,311 --> 00:05:57,098
See, epidermis means your hair.

69
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:02,603
So technically it's true.
That's what makes it so funny.

70
00:06:02,947 --> 00:06:04,774
Pardon me a moment.

71
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:10,786
Hey, Nelson. He's really hurt.
I think he broke his leg.

72
00:06:10,955 --> 00:06:12,154
I said:

73
00:06:28,387 --> 00:06:30,298
Get this kid a magazine, stat.

74
00:06:32,477 --> 00:06:35,145
I'm sorry, that leg's gonna
have to come off.

75
00:06:37,315 --> 00:06:40,897
Did I say leg?
I meant that wet bathing suit.

76
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:44,230
I'm afraid you'll need a cast
on that broken bone.

77
00:06:45,365 --> 00:06:47,191
I'm gonna miss the whole summer.

78
00:06:47,367 --> 00:06:51,943
Don't worry, boy. When you get a job
like me, you'll miss every summer.

79
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:54,735
Isn't it amazing, the same
day you got a pool...

80
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:57,072
...is the same day we realized
we liked you?

81
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:59,498
The timing worked out great,
don't you think?

82
00:07:00,421 --> 00:07:03,042
- Hi.
- Hey, guys! Sign my cast?

83
00:07:03,216 --> 00:07:05,837
Sign my cast? Guys?

84
00:07:08,346 --> 00:07:11,467
- Milhouse!
- Hi, Bart.

85
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:17,224
Faithful Milhouse. You'll spend the long,
hot days by my side, won't you?

86
00:07:17,438 --> 00:07:21,517
I think I lost my glasses in your pool.
I better go in and find them.

87
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:25,106
- But you're wearing your glasses.
- No, I'm not.

88
00:07:27,154 --> 00:07:28,814
Oh, look. Bart's all alone.

89
00:07:29,197 --> 00:07:31,193
Maybe I should keep him company,
at least for a little while.

90
00:07:33,371 --> 00:07:35,244
- Hey, come watch this.
- Lisa! Hey, look.

91
00:07:41,963 --> 00:07:43,755
Coming!

92
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:49,252
Well, it looks like it's just
you and me, Barty boy.

93
00:07:49,638 --> 00:07:53,086
Great. I get to spend
the summer with my brain.

94
00:07:53,515 --> 00:07:57,178
What fun can you have in a pool anyway
that you can't have in a bathtub...

95
00:07:57,351 --> 00:07:59,807
...with a garbage bag taped
around your cast?

96
00:08:41,273 --> 00:08:46,812
Traitors! Go on and have your pool!
I'm fine by myself right here.

97
00:09:44,044 --> 00:09:46,082
You know, this isn't so bad.

98
00:09:46,295 --> 00:09:48,965
I'll just spend the summer
getting better acquainted...

99
00:09:49,132 --> 00:09:51,965
...with an old friend called television.

100
00:09:55,594 --> 00:09:59,722
Hope you enjoyed that, kids, because
Krusty's out of here for the summer.

101
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:02,389
In the meantime, we'll be running...

102
00:10:03,228 --> 00:10:07,012
...classic Krusty. Enjoy!

103
00:10:11,321 --> 00:10:16,113
Good evening. Tonight my guest
is AFL-CIO Chairman George Meany...

104
00:10:16,325 --> 00:10:19,161
...who will be discussing
collective-bargaining agreements.

105
00:10:19,371 --> 00:10:22,120
- It's a pleasure to be here, Krusty.
- Let me be blunt.

106
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:25,164
Is there a labor crisis
in America today?

107
00:10:25,332 --> 00:10:27,490
Well, that depends
what you mean by crisis.

108
00:10:30,506 --> 00:10:32,961
There's nothing like
rising with the sun...

109
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:37,131
...for a quiet, peaceful dip
in your very own pool.

110
00:10:46,147 --> 00:10:49,563
Lisa, the blob has got me!
Don't touch me or it'll get you too!

111
00:10:49,734 --> 00:10:54,145
Dad, you have to put chlorine in
the water every day to keep it clean.

112
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:56,188
Chlorine, eh?

113
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:01,782
My face is on fire!

114
00:11:03,538 --> 00:11:06,539
Oh, look. There's Bart. Wave to him.

115
00:11:09,545 --> 00:11:11,872
Maybe we should spend
more time with Bart.

116
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:14,795
He's becoming isolated and weird.

117
00:11:15,135 --> 00:11:19,713
"I swear I don't know where the
bombs are! Only the miners know that!"

118
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:24,099
"Maybe this will loosen your tongue. "
"No!"

119
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:27,219
- Bart?
- Don't turn on that light!

120
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:29,725
Sorry, I just came to see
how you were feeling.

121
00:11:29,898 --> 00:11:32,733
- I'm fine, just fine.
- What are you writing here, a play?

122
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:36,149
- No.
- "Cast of characters:

123
00:11:36,321 --> 00:11:39,275
Viceroy Fizzlebottom,
a hearty cherub of a man... "

124
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:41,693
Give me that! It's a work in progress.

125
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:44,705
So.

126
00:11:44,915 --> 00:11:46,706
How do you like
being Miss Popularity?

127
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:49,827
Oh, well, you know, it ain't so great.

128
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:54,586
Bart, it's the best thing that ever
happened to me in my whole life!

129
00:11:54,756 --> 00:11:58,254
Well, anyway, I brought you a present.
Look, it's the telescope I won...

130
00:11:58,425 --> 00:11:59,754
...at the Optics Festival.

131
00:11:59,928 --> 00:12:03,463
There was an Optics Festival
and I wasn't informed? You go now.

132
00:12:03,682 --> 00:12:05,259
- But...
- Go!

133
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:12,724
What have we here?
"The Lighter Side of Hippies. "

134
00:12:13,694 --> 00:12:16,479
They don't care whose toes
they step on.

135
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:27,531
This was a lovely idea, Homie.

136
00:12:27,704 --> 00:12:29,994
Come here and kiss me.

137
00:12:35,005 --> 00:12:39,133
Do not be alarmed.
Continue swimming naked.

138
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:45,675
Come on. Continue. Come on...

139
00:12:46,309 --> 00:12:47,933
All right, Lou, open fire.

140
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,524
Wow, the universe is so boring.

141
00:12:56,775 --> 00:13:01,772
I know. I'll use this to peer into
Springfield's seamy underbelly.

142
00:13:09,332 --> 00:13:11,740
It turned out it was his evil twin.

143
00:13:16,547 --> 00:13:20,922
Grace, come here. There's a
sinister-looking kid I want you to see.

144
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:26,380
I'm never gonna see anything interesting
with this stupid piece of junk.

145
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:34,602
That came from Flanders' house.

146
00:13:44,242 --> 00:13:47,741
Oh, my God! What have I done?
I've killed her!

147
00:13:49,038 --> 00:13:52,737
It can't be what it looks like.
This is Flanders we're talking about.

148
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:55,160
I'll just watch some TV.

149
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:59,955
Now, what you've been waiting for:
Another long raga by Ravi Shankar.

150
00:14:01,258 --> 00:14:02,836
- Shankar.
- Shankar.

151
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:04,967
Groovy, man.

152
00:14:15,315 --> 00:14:19,607
This can't be what it looks like.
There's gotta be some other explanation.

153
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:23,820
I wish there was some other
explanation for this, but there isn't!

154
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:26,235
I'm a murderer! I'm a murderer!

155
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:28,738
Then that's not the real Ned Flanders.

156
00:14:29,286 --> 00:14:32,037
I'm a mur-diddly-erdiler!

157
00:14:32,331 --> 00:14:35,166
If that's not Flanders,
he's done his homework.

158
00:14:40,299 --> 00:14:42,338
Daddy, where's Mommy?
We miss her.

159
00:14:42,509 --> 00:14:45,509
Mommy had to go away.
She's with God now.

160
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:48,422
Can we go there too?

161
00:14:48,681 --> 00:14:50,506
Soon enough.

162
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:54,676
He's gonna kill Rod and Todd too!

163
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:56,559
That's horrible...

164
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:58,301
...in principle.

165
00:14:59,483 --> 00:15:03,148
Look, Lisa. I found this change
on the bottom of the pool.

166
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:06,106
- You can have it.
- Thanks, Nelson.

167
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:10,161
Somebody took my juice money.

168
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:13,740
Lisa, please join my family
for a weekend in the country.

169
00:15:14,124 --> 00:15:15,747
There'll be hunting, charades...

170
00:15:15,917 --> 00:15:19,035
...and ever so many delightful,
romantic misunderstandings.

171
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:21,375
- Lisa, Lisa!
- Watch me!

172
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:24,543
They're only using you
for your pool, you know.

173
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:28,126
Shut up, brain. I got friends now.
I don't need you anymore.

174
00:15:30,013 --> 00:15:33,596
Yeah, I'd love to go to your house.

175
00:15:36,686 --> 00:15:38,514
My plan has come to fruition.

176
00:15:38,688 --> 00:15:40,813
Soon I'll be queen of summertime.

177
00:15:41,109 --> 00:15:42,567
Oh, king. King!

178
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:54,322
Dude, buzz has it an even wussier kid
has an even better pool than this.

179
00:16:01,587 --> 00:16:05,252
Hello? Hey, I'm stuck in here.

180
00:16:05,424 --> 00:16:07,581
I gotta think of a way to get out.

181
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:11,718
Well, well, well.
Look who's come crawling back.

182
00:16:12,098 --> 00:16:14,934
Listen, Ned Flanders murdered his wife!

183
00:16:15,143 --> 00:16:17,468
But why? She's such a fox.

184
00:16:17,645 --> 00:16:21,095
I mean, what's on Fox tonight?
Something ribald, no doubt.

185
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:24,013
I wish you'd stop spreading
bad rumors about people.

186
00:16:24,192 --> 00:16:26,516
Remember how you got Grampa
tarred and feathered?

187
00:16:26,693 --> 00:16:28,152
Sure. That was 20 minutes ago.

188
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:29,863
Gonna be in the tub for a while.

189
00:16:32,033 --> 00:16:34,738
Bart, I'm really sorry
I've been ignoring you lately.

190
00:16:34,912 --> 00:16:37,153
I got carried away with being popular.

191
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:41,247
But now that I'm unpopular again,
I want you to know I'm here for you.

192
00:16:41,461 --> 00:16:43,620
You can start making it up
to me right now.

193
00:16:43,796 --> 00:16:46,833
Flanders is leaving the house.
I want you to sneak in there...

194
00:16:47,007 --> 00:16:49,461
...and bring me some evidence!
And something sweet.

195
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:52,297
Bart, I'm not gonna
break into somebody's house.

196
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:55,181
All right. You're right.
Let's just forget about that.

197
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:58,265
Here, let me read to you
from my play.

198
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:03,264
"Kippers for breakfast, Aunt Helga?
Is it Saint Swiven's Day already?

199
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:08,067
- 'Tis, replied Aunt Helga... "
- I'm going, I'm going.

200
00:17:21,082 --> 00:17:22,707
A human head!

201
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:27,998
Of course.

202
00:17:29,674 --> 00:17:31,714
Oh, no.
He's back. Flanders is back.

203
00:17:31,885 --> 00:17:33,427
Lisa, get out of there!

204
00:17:34,721 --> 00:17:37,556
No, Lisa, don't go upstairs.
You'll be trapped!

205
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:41,351
An ax! He's got an ax!

206
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,679
I'll save you, Lisa!

207
00:17:45,275 --> 00:17:47,351
I'll save you by calling the police.

208
00:17:48,358 --> 00:17:52,570
Hello, and welcome to the Springfield
Police Department Rescue Phone.

209
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:56,438
If you know the name of the felony
being committed, press one.

210
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:59,702
To choose from a list of felonies,
press two.

211
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:03,123
If you are being murdered
or calling from a rotary phone...

212
00:18:03,292 --> 00:18:06,078
...please stay on the line.

213
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:09,120
You have selected regicide.

214
00:18:09,298 --> 00:18:13,877
If you know the name of the king
or queen being murdered, press one.

215
00:18:20,975 --> 00:18:23,051
I'll save you, cast or no cast!

216
00:18:26,397 --> 00:18:30,976
Gotta save Lisa,
trash can or no trash can.

217
00:18:44,792 --> 00:18:48,918
Oh, no. That sinister-looking kid
is coming to kill me.

218
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:51,292
Help! Help!

219
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:02,800
Oh, no. Oh, no.

220
00:19:37,803 --> 00:19:41,137
It's time to put you away.

221
00:19:42,475 --> 00:19:44,550
Put you away for good.

222
00:19:46,937 --> 00:19:49,143
No!

223
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:53,230
What the gumdrops is going on here?

224
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:57,060
I came to stop you from murdering Lisa
like you murdered your wife!

225
00:19:57,238 --> 00:19:59,112
Murdered?

226
00:20:02,619 --> 00:20:05,406
Murdered? No, I've just been
in the country for a week.

227
00:20:05,581 --> 00:20:08,451
But I distinctly heard you say
that Maude was with God.

228
00:20:08,667 --> 00:20:13,376
That's right. I was at Bible camp. I was
learning how to be more judgmental.

229
00:20:13,589 --> 00:20:17,288
But I saw the murder, and then I saw
you bury the corpse in the backyard!

230
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:20,337
All right, it's true! I am a murderer!

231
00:20:21,512 --> 00:20:23,801
I over-watered Maude's
favorite ficus plant...

232
00:20:23,973 --> 00:20:26,724
...I panicked, and then
I buried the remains.

233
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:29,640
I was hoping to replace it
before you got home.

234
00:20:30,105 --> 00:20:32,062
But I heard a woman scream.

235
00:20:33,107 --> 00:20:36,891
- Well, now, that I can't explain.
- We found it, chief.

236
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,272
Well, I guess that explains everything.

237
00:20:40,449 --> 00:20:45,491
Not everything. There's still the little
matter of the whereabouts of your wife.

238
00:20:45,872 --> 00:20:48,158
- I'm right here.
- Oh, I see.

239
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:51,658
Then everything is wrapped up
in a neat little package.

240
00:20:52,669 --> 00:20:54,127
Really, I mean that.

241
00:20:54,337 --> 00:20:56,494
Sorry if it sounded sarcastic.

242
00:21:00,385 --> 00:21:02,591
More friends! More allies!

243
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:05,597
More, I say.
Hang those who talk of less.

244
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:08,007
There's a few inches over here.

245
00:21:15,651 --> 00:21:18,935
My precious pool
and its lifestyle accouterments.

246
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:20,570
No!

247
00:21:21,197 --> 00:21:23,320
- What a drag.
- I hear you.

248
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:35,034
The gentle caress of a summer breeze.

249
00:21:36,034 --> 00:21:46,034
