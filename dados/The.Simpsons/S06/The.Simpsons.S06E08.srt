1
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:07,645
Lisa on Ice

2
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:39,968
It's Channel 6 Action News.

3
00:00:41,722 --> 00:00:43,596
Ah, Action News.

4
00:00:43,766 --> 00:00:46,767
The last place an impressionable kid
can go for TV violence.

5
00:00:46,935 --> 00:00:50,200
Now here's your Action anchor,
Kent Brockman.

6
00:00:50,189 --> 00:00:52,561
Hello, I'm Kent Brockman!
Our top stories tonight:

7
00:00:52,733 --> 00:00:55,220
A tremendous explosion
in the price of lumber.

8
00:00:55,194 --> 00:00:57,519
"President Reagan dyes...

9
00:00:57,696 --> 00:01:00,816
...his hair, " says Gary Trudeau
in his new musical comedy review.

10
00:01:00,991 --> 00:01:04,277
But first let's check the death count
from the killer storm...

11
00:01:04,453 --> 00:01:07,205
...bearing down on us
like a shotgun full of snow.

12
00:01:08,916 --> 00:01:12,534
As of now, the death count is zero.
But it is ready to shoot right up.

13
00:01:12,795 --> 00:01:16,413
Oh, my God!
Damn you, snow!

14
00:01:16,632 --> 00:01:19,586
All right! Snow day!
No school tomorrow!

15
00:01:21,136 --> 00:01:24,422
That doesn't mean no book report.
What if the weatherman is wrong?

16
00:01:24,598 --> 00:01:27,469
Lisa, that man is a
professional meteorologist.

17
00:01:27,643 --> 00:01:30,644
Kent, I'd like to remind everybody
to come down and watch me...

18
00:01:30,813 --> 00:01:34,182
...at the Springfield Laugh and Brew
and Burgers and Fries on Saturday.

19
00:01:34,358 --> 00:01:38,225
The forecast calls for
a 75%/% chance of hilarity.

20
00:01:38,445 --> 00:01:39,856
I like those odds.

21
00:01:41,824 --> 00:01:43,448
Snowball fight!

22
00:01:52,584 --> 00:01:54,743
You're gonna eat a blizzard of...

23
00:01:54,962 --> 00:01:56,919
...unseasonable warmth?

24
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:00,256
I made the snowball from the frost
in our freezer.

25
00:02:02,261 --> 00:02:04,550
Nice P.J. S, Simpson.

26
00:02:04,722 --> 00:02:06,928
Did your mommy buy them for you?

27
00:02:07,308 --> 00:02:09,181
Of course she did.
Who else would have?

28
00:02:10,936 --> 00:02:15,645
All right, Simpson.
You win this round.

29
00:02:16,275 --> 00:02:18,149
Okay, it's book report time.

30
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:22,610
We'll do them alphabetically.
Today it's A through M.

31
00:02:22,281 --> 00:02:25,566
I'm saved!
I love being a Simpson.

32
00:02:25,784 --> 00:02:27,409
Let's see. We have no A's.

33
00:02:27,578 --> 00:02:29,701
So let's go right to the B's.
Bart.

34
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:32,540
Mrs. Krabappel...

35
00:02:32,708 --> 00:02:34,997
...I didn't...

36
00:02:35,169 --> 00:02:37,161
Attention. This is Principal Skinner...

37
00:02:37,379 --> 00:02:40,416
...your principal, with a message
from the principal's office.

38
00:02:40,633 --> 00:02:43,254
All students proceed immediately
to an assembly...

39
00:02:43,469 --> 00:02:45,177
...in the Butthead Memorial Auditorium.

40
00:02:45,471 --> 00:02:48,900
Damn it, I wish we hadn't let
the students name that.

41
00:02:48,223 --> 00:02:52,700
Children, the times they are
becoming quite different.

42
00:02:52,353 --> 00:02:54,760
Test scores are at an all-time low.

43
00:02:54,938 --> 00:02:57,975
So I've come up with these
academic alerts!

44
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:02,170
You will receive one as soon as
your grades start to slip in any subject.

45
00:03:02,196 --> 00:03:05,316
Your parents won't have to wait
until report cards to punish you.

46
00:03:05,532 --> 00:03:07,406
How innovative. I like it.

47
00:03:07,743 --> 00:03:11,491
Hey, Dolph, take a memo
on your Newton: Beat up Martin.

48
00:03:15,876 --> 00:03:17,287
Bah!

49
00:03:17,586 --> 00:03:20,753
All right, first academic alert:
Wiggum, Ralph.

50
00:03:20,923 --> 00:03:23,414
I won! I won!

51
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:28,178
No. No, Ralph.
This means you're failing English.

52
00:03:28,389 --> 00:03:31,592
Me fail English?
That's "unpossible."

53
00:03:31,809 --> 00:03:35,972
Muntz, Nelson. You're failing
history, geography and math.

54
00:03:36,188 --> 00:03:40,400
- But you're doing quite well in home ec.
- Hey! Keep it down, man.

55
00:03:40,609 --> 00:03:42,151
Simpson...

56
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:44,270
...Lisa.

57
00:03:44,196 --> 00:03:47,731
Grades are all I have.
What could I be failing?

58
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:50,156
I'm smart and a teacher's pet.

59
00:03:52,162 --> 00:03:57,239
Gym?! That's the stupidest thing
I ever heard!

60
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,543
Lisa, your father and I are very
concerned about this warning.

61
00:04:08,762 --> 00:04:10,802
I really hope you try harder.

62
00:04:11,223 --> 00:04:15,268
That's all of them. And I'm so proud
you didn't try to forge my name.

63
00:04:15,436 --> 00:04:16,846
How about a present, son?

64
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:19,221
Well, I could use a new pair
of hockey skates.

65
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,563
- Done and done.
- That's not fair.

66
00:04:21,775 --> 00:04:24,562
Why is Bart getting a present,
and I'm getting chewed out?

67
00:04:24,737 --> 00:04:27,620
Ah, the mysteries of life.

68
00:04:27,239 --> 00:04:28,568
Tell you what, Simpson.

69
00:04:28,782 --> 00:04:32,827
I won't fail you if you join one of
those Pee Wee teams outside the school.

70
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:35,954
You mean, where parents push kids
into vicious competition...

71
00:04:36,123 --> 00:04:38,696
...to compensate for
their own failed dreams of glory?

72
00:04:38,917 --> 00:04:40,495
Look, I don't need this.

73
00:04:40,669 --> 00:04:43,706
I inhaled my favorite whistle
this morning.

74
00:04:58,896 --> 00:05:03,807
Children, that was our only ball.
There'll be no team this year.

75
00:05:07,947 --> 00:05:12,608
Mom, this is really scary.
I'm gonna get my first F ever.

76
00:05:12,785 --> 00:05:16,569
Cheer up. So you're not good at sports.
It's a very small part of life.

77
00:05:16,789 --> 00:05:19,458
Sports, sports, sports, sports

78
00:05:19,667 --> 00:05:24,163
Marge, Bart rides up in the front seat
today because he's a good guy at sports.

79
00:05:24,338 --> 00:05:27,430
I think Lisa needs to feel
a little special tonight.

80
00:05:27,216 --> 00:05:30,252
How about letting her
ride up front too?

81
00:05:30,803 --> 00:05:32,131
I tried.

82
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:37,724
Okay, son. Just remember
to have fun out there today.

83
00:05:37,893 --> 00:05:43,232
- And if you lose, I'll kill you!
- Oh, Dad.

84
00:05:50,447 --> 00:05:52,155
All right, Pigs, beat those Gougers.

85
00:05:57,413 --> 00:06:01,161
I could've been equipment manager,
but no!

86
00:06:12,594 --> 00:06:14,836
Our goalie cannot stand up.

87
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:16,389
Tell you what, get some rope.

88
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,646
Defense! Defense!
Come on! You call that blowing!

89
00:06:38,162 --> 00:06:41,744
Oh, yes, we won!
We won! We won!

90
00:06:41,915 --> 00:06:44,751
Unfortunately, since I bet
on the other team...

91
00:06:44,918 --> 00:06:46,792
...we won't be going for pizza.

92
00:06:47,796 --> 00:06:52,458
Well, boy, you won. So I'm gonna live up
to my side of the agreement.

93
00:06:52,676 --> 00:06:55,346
Here's your turtle, alive and well.

94
00:06:55,512 --> 00:06:58,264
Aw, thanks, Dad.

95
00:06:58,974 --> 00:07:01,181
How about some adulation
from my little sister?

96
00:07:01,393 --> 00:07:05,110
Wow, Bart, I'm so impressed you were
able to give Milhouse a concussion.

97
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:06,890
Aw, you're just jealous.

98
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:11,526
Because... you... stink... at... sports!

99
00:07:11,737 --> 00:07:13,564
- Cut it out, Bart!
- What the...?

100
00:07:15,741 --> 00:07:20,533
You know, I wonder if her skills
will transfer over to the game of hockey.

101
00:07:20,704 --> 00:07:24,998
Well, only one way to be sure.
Heads up, little girl!

102
00:07:28,128 --> 00:07:30,251
The goalie of my dreams!

103
00:07:32,508 --> 00:07:35,378
Let's try a hard one to make sure
it wasn't a fluke.

104
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:41,715
Hey! Way to knock out my teeth!

105
00:07:41,892 --> 00:07:44,383
Yeah, that's it, Milhouse.
Keep up the chatter.

106
00:07:49,233 --> 00:07:53,646
Lisa, if the Bible has taught us
nothing else, and it hasn't...

107
00:07:53,821 --> 00:07:56,312
...it's that girls should stick
to girl sports.

108
00:07:56,490 --> 00:08:00,702
Such as hot oil wrestling, foxy boxing
and such and such.

109
00:08:00,911 --> 00:08:03,580
I think women should be able to play
any sport men play.

110
00:08:03,747 --> 00:08:07,827
But hockey is so violent and dangerous.
Look at Milhouse's teeth.

111
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,793
Mom, will you stop showing us those?

112
00:08:09,962 --> 00:08:12,850
I have to join the team
or I'll get an F...

113
00:08:12,256 --> 00:08:14,961
...that will haunt me
for the rest of my life.

114
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:19,379
I now pronounce you
president of these United...

115
00:08:19,555 --> 00:08:22,924
Stop the inauguration! I just discovered
our president-elect...

116
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,974
...got an F in second-grade gym class!

117
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:31,478
In that case, I sentence you to a lifetime
of horror on Monster Island.

118
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:33,442
Don't worry. It's just a name.

119
00:08:37,781 --> 00:08:40,153
He said it was just a name!

120
00:08:40,326 --> 00:08:43,529
What he meant is that Monster Island
is actually a peninsula.

121
00:08:47,291 --> 00:08:49,746
Do you have my teeth?

122
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:52,748
No.

123
00:08:56,216 --> 00:08:59,170
Okay, hotshots. Now that my daughter
is on your team...

124
00:08:59,345 --> 00:09:01,503
...I want to make a few things clear.

125
00:09:01,722 --> 00:09:03,679
Please, Dad. I'll be fine.

126
00:09:05,225 --> 00:09:09,472
I don't want anyone to give her
a hard time just because she's different.

127
00:09:09,646 --> 00:09:11,888
No jokes, no taunting...

128
00:09:12,733 --> 00:09:15,734
Look! That kid's got bosoms!
Who's got a wet towel?

129
00:09:16,862 --> 00:09:19,151
Come here, you butterball.

130
00:09:19,365 --> 00:09:22,615
Don't make me run!
I'm full of chocolate!

131
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:33,706
I can't watch. I don't know how
you two can sit here...

132
00:09:33,879 --> 00:09:36,833
...laughing at poor Lisa
while she's probably scared to death.

133
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:42,214
We're laughing with her, Marge.
There's a big difference.

134
00:09:46,642 --> 00:09:47,970
With her.

135
00:09:48,185 --> 00:09:50,308
You really think I did okay
out there, Mom?

136
00:09:50,521 --> 00:09:55,990
Absolutely, honey. By blocking the net,
I really think you helped your team.

137
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,317
Okay, little buddy. Hop in.

138
00:09:59,947 --> 00:10:02,236
I mean my little girl buddy.

139
00:10:02,449 --> 00:10:06,696
That's very nice, but it's wrong for you
to reward violent, competitive behavior.

140
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:10,453
However, I will sit up front with you
if it's a fatherly gesture of love.

141
00:10:10,666 --> 00:10:12,208
Okay, hon.

142
00:10:12,376 --> 00:10:15,827
Sucker! Competitive violence,
that's why you're here!

143
00:10:37,192 --> 00:10:39,565
We're having our best season ever.

144
00:10:39,778 --> 00:10:43,646
And I would like to say that
it is because of teamwork.

145
00:10:43,866 --> 00:10:46,617
Gee, who am I kidding, huh?
It's all because of Lisa.

146
00:10:46,827 --> 00:10:49,330
Let's hear it for Lisa!

147
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:54,623
Hey, Bart. If Lisa's better than you
at hockey...

148
00:10:54,835 --> 00:10:58,584
...does that mean you're gonna become
better than her at school?

149
00:10:58,964 --> 00:11:04,884
Maybe I will, Milhouse.
Maybe I will.

150
00:11:08,599 --> 00:11:11,386
Who can tell me the capital of Spain?
Bart Simpson.

151
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:14,810
The square root of 36?
Bart Simpson.

152
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:17,352
Who freed the slaves?
Bart Simpson.

153
00:11:17,608 --> 00:11:19,980
Bart Simpson. Bart Simpson.

154
00:11:20,152 --> 00:11:24,660
Bart Simpson, stop raising your hand.
You haven't had one right answer today.

155
00:11:24,281 --> 00:11:25,906
Sorry.

156
00:11:26,325 --> 00:11:29,445
This is for wasting
teacher's valuable time!

157
00:11:32,498 --> 00:11:35,249
Lay off, guys! He's with me.

158
00:11:35,709 --> 00:11:39,493
It's a lucky coincidence
you happen to be your sister's brother.

159
00:11:39,672 --> 00:11:42,708
Don't worry, Bart.
They won't bother you anymore.

160
00:11:46,428 --> 00:11:49,215
I hardly ever let Mother
fight for me anymore.

161
00:11:49,431 --> 00:11:52,516
Sorry, Bart. I'm gonna hang out
with Lisa...

162
00:11:52,685 --> 00:11:54,143
...for protection...

163
00:11:54,311 --> 00:11:56,600
...and to be seen!

164
00:11:59,108 --> 00:12:00,483
Come watch TV with me, Dad.

165
00:12:00,693 --> 00:12:04,358
We missed the first two Cops, but if
we hurry, we can catch the last three.

166
00:12:04,571 --> 00:12:07,608
Oh, sorry, Bart. Lisa and I are going out
for gelato.

167
00:12:07,783 --> 00:12:10,155
We'd ask you to come, but...

168
00:12:10,327 --> 00:12:11,656
...you know.

169
00:12:13,664 --> 00:12:16,949
- Bart, I can spend some time with you.
- I don't know, Mom.

170
00:12:17,126 --> 00:12:20,376
Don't have a stereotypical view of me
just because I'm your mother.

171
00:12:20,546 --> 00:12:23,962
I know. How about we play
the basketball?

172
00:12:24,133 --> 00:12:27,299
I'm no Harvey Globetrotter, but...

173
00:12:28,721 --> 00:12:31,176
Watch out for the Shaq attack!

174
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:35,142
I told you to watch out.

175
00:12:35,352 --> 00:12:38,139
Hey, Milhouse! Knock him down
if he's in your way!

176
00:12:38,355 --> 00:12:39,897
Jimbo, Jimbo! Go for the face!

177
00:12:40,107 --> 00:12:42,978
Look! Ralph Wiggum lost
his shinguard!

178
00:12:43,193 --> 00:12:46,290
Hack the bone!
Hack the bone!

179
00:12:46,238 --> 00:12:49,690
Wow! Eye of the tiger!
Mouth of a teamster!

180
00:12:49,992 --> 00:12:54,203
To think of all the time
I wasted on you!

181
00:12:54,788 --> 00:12:57,825
Well, not wasted...

182
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:59,909
I love you.

183
00:13:00,878 --> 00:13:04,828
Let me give my special little winner
a big, big hug.

184
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:08,714
Ma. I think I'm all hugged out.

185
00:13:08,886 --> 00:13:11,174
Ah, one more.

186
00:13:15,559 --> 00:13:16,888
Hello, Queen Lisa.

187
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:18,804
Bart! What are you doing in my room?

188
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:23,517
Lisa, certain differences, rivalries
if you will, have come up between us.

189
00:13:23,692 --> 00:13:27,610
At first, I thought we could talk it over
like civilized people.

190
00:13:27,237 --> 00:13:32,480
But instead, I just ripped the head
off Mr. Honey Bunny!

191
00:13:32,701 --> 00:13:35,260
Bart, that was your cherished
childhood toy.

192
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:38,327
Mr. Honey Bunny!

193
00:13:40,918 --> 00:13:43,491
- Quiet down, Bart!
- Bart, just get out of here.

194
00:13:43,712 --> 00:13:46,547
- It's a free country. You get out.
- That doesn't make sense.

195
00:13:46,757 --> 00:13:48,335
I know you are, but what am I?

196
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:49,879
Get out! Get out!

197
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:55,129
Okay! But on my way,
I'm gonna be doing this:

198
00:13:55,349 --> 00:13:59,810
If you get hit, it's your own fault.

199
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:03,804
Okay. Then I'm gonna start
kicking air like this:

200
00:14:03,983 --> 00:14:09,653
And if any part of you should fill that air,
it's your own fault.

201
00:14:19,707 --> 00:14:21,249
I better go check that out.

202
00:14:21,458 --> 00:14:25,408
Now, Homer, don't you eat this pie.

203
00:14:25,921 --> 00:14:27,463
Okay.

204
00:14:27,631 --> 00:14:30,870
All right, pie,
I'm just gonna do this:

205
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,336
And if you get eaten,
it's your own fault.

206
00:14:38,851 --> 00:14:40,974
Oh, my...

207
00:14:41,145 --> 00:14:43,221
Oh, the hell with it.

208
00:14:46,525 --> 00:14:51,104
Stop it! Stop it, stop it, stop it!
Stop it!

209
00:14:51,321 --> 00:14:52,697
Mom, that is really annoying.

210
00:14:52,865 --> 00:14:54,941
- Bart started it.
- Lisa started it.

211
00:14:55,159 --> 00:14:57,780
I don't care who started it!
I don't want to see you...

212
00:14:57,995 --> 00:14:59,573
...fighting like that ever again.

213
00:14:59,747 --> 00:15:02,831
We love you both. You're not
in competition with each other.

214
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:06,700
Repeat, you are not in competition
with each other.

215
00:15:06,879 --> 00:15:11,588
Hey! Apu just called. This Friday,
Lisa's team is playing Bart's team.

216
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:13,502
You're in direct competition!

217
00:15:13,677 --> 00:15:16,631
Don't go easy on each other
because you're brother and sister.

218
00:15:16,805 --> 00:15:20,305
I want to see you both fighting
for your parents' love!

219
00:15:20,476 --> 00:15:25,185
Fight! Fight! Fight!

220
00:15:29,902 --> 00:15:32,274
Okay, I'm gonna make
a little deal with you mugs.

221
00:15:32,488 --> 00:15:35,260
I'm gonna let you out to see my team
play the game...

222
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:37,275
...if you promise to return
to your cells.

223
00:15:37,451 --> 00:15:40,950
Sorry, pig.
We can't make that promise.

224
00:15:41,163 --> 00:15:43,535
All right. All right,
I'll sweeten the deal.

225
00:15:43,707 --> 00:15:46,198
You can see the game,
you don't have to come back...

226
00:15:46,377 --> 00:15:50,457
...but you have to promise
not to commit any more crimes, okay?

227
00:15:50,672 --> 00:15:53,673
- No.
- I'll take that as a yes.

228
00:15:53,842 --> 00:15:56,131
All right, we're free!

229
00:15:56,387 --> 00:16:02,100
At 7 tonight the games begin
Bart versus Lisa, who will win?

230
00:16:02,184 --> 00:16:07,807
Their father's fat and their mother's thin
And Grampa Simpson reeks of gin

231
00:16:07,982 --> 00:16:10,389
Hey!

232
00:16:10,567 --> 00:16:13,272
That's Obsession for Men.

233
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:17,238
Pass ketchup.

234
00:16:18,784 --> 00:16:22,200
You'll have to do better
than that tonight, chump.

235
00:16:23,372 --> 00:16:27,452
I asked for ketchup!
I'm eating salad here.

236
00:16:27,668 --> 00:16:30,835
I won't have any aggressive
condiment-passing in this house.

237
00:16:31,505 --> 00:16:33,628
- Hello.
- Moe, what are you doing here?

238
00:16:33,841 --> 00:16:37,755
What? What? A bartender can't come by
and say hi to his best customer?

239
00:16:37,928 --> 00:16:41,546
Hey, hey there, Midge. Oh, gee,
I like what you done to your hair.

240
00:16:41,765 --> 00:16:43,639
You caught me
at a real bad time, Moe.

241
00:16:43,809 --> 00:16:46,561
I hope you understand I'm too tense
to pretend I like you.

242
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:50,353
Yeah, and how are the little kids doing?
I mean, really, how are they doing?

243
00:16:50,524 --> 00:16:53,691
Any disabling injuries? Something
that the gambling community...

244
00:16:53,861 --> 00:16:56,612
...might not yet know about?
Here, let me see those knees.

245
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:58,274
Moe, I think you should leave.

246
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:02,109
But Blanche, you gotta help me out here!
Please! I'm 64 grand in the hole!

247
00:17:02,328 --> 00:17:04,404
They're gonna take my thumbs!

248
00:17:06,665 --> 00:17:09,239
Charge!

249
00:17:09,793 --> 00:17:13,494
Good luck tonight, sis.
I'll try not to hurt you!

250
00:17:13,672 --> 00:17:17,717
Don't worry. I'm wearing
my lucky rabbit's head.

251
00:17:17,885 --> 00:17:20,340
Mr. Honey Bunny!
You inhumane monster!

252
00:17:20,512 --> 00:17:22,754
You want a piece of me?

253
00:17:22,932 --> 00:17:24,758
Hey, hey. Stop it, stop it!

254
00:17:24,933 --> 00:17:27,560
Conserve your precious hatred
for the game.

255
00:17:27,269 --> 00:17:29,558
Now that we're all alone, Marge,
admit it.

256
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:31,473
- You like Lisa best.
- No!

257
00:17:31,648 --> 00:17:33,974
- Oh, so you're a Bart woman, are you?
- No.

258
00:17:34,151 --> 00:17:37,105
You can't possible like Maggie best.
What has she ever done?

259
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:39,188
Nothing for nobody.

260
00:17:39,406 --> 00:17:41,778
Homer, we can't root for one child
over the other.

261
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:44,702
You wouldn't like it if the kids
played favorites with us.

262
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:49,496
- Hey, Mom! Look at me, Mom!
- Hi, Mom, over here! Mom!

263
00:17:50,167 --> 00:17:51,495
Hi, kids.

264
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:56,880
And now to honor America,
here's Krusty the Clown.

265
00:18:12,147 --> 00:18:15,148
Shouldn't have turned down
those cue cards.

266
00:18:27,246 --> 00:18:28,574
I love Bart!

267
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:36,430
No, wait! I love Lisa!

268
00:18:36,213 --> 00:18:38,965
Beer? Oh, Marge, I love you.

269
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:06,611
He tripped my boy!

270
00:19:06,785 --> 00:19:10,154
I demand vengeance!
I want vengeance!

271
00:19:10,664 --> 00:19:13,499
Jimbo Jones called for tripping.

272
00:19:13,709 --> 00:19:16,663
A penalty shot will be taken
by Bart Simpson.

273
00:19:18,881 --> 00:19:21,632
Oh, my God. A penalty shot
with only four seconds left.

274
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:25,134
It's your child versus mine!
The winner will be showered with praise!

275
00:19:25,304 --> 00:19:28,969
The loser will be taunted and booed
until my throat is sore!

276
00:19:33,687 --> 00:19:35,630
Kill her, boy! Kill her!

277
00:19:36,106 --> 00:19:37,731
Stop him dead, little girl!

278
00:19:37,941 --> 00:19:40,812
Kill, Bart! Kill, Bart! Kill, Bart!

279
00:19:40,986 --> 00:19:44,153
Kill Bart! Kill Bart! Kill Bart!

280
00:19:48,702 --> 00:19:52,710
Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!

281
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:42,706
Great game, Lis.

282
00:20:42,881 --> 00:20:45,419
Great game, Bart.

283
00:20:49,555 --> 00:20:51,346
- Tie game?!
- What the hell?!

284
00:20:51,515 --> 00:20:52,843
This is outrageous.

285
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:57,970
Oh, I've never been so proud of them.

286
00:21:00,274 --> 00:21:03,275
They're both losers. Losers!

287
00:21:03,485 --> 00:21:06,854
- Rip off!
- We paid for blood!

288
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:08,899
Let's tear this place apart!

289
00:21:09,116 --> 00:21:10,907
Good idea!

290
00:21:16,373 --> 00:21:20,371
Those kids are, like, so sweet.

291
00:21:21,211 --> 00:21:26,170
If only they had had Pee Wee
hockey when I was a lad.

292
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:28,919
Oh, well.
