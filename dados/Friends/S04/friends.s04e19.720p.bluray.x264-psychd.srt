MAN [SINGING]:
Morning's here

2
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:14,096
The morning's here

3
00:00:14,264 --> 00:00:16,682
Sunshine is here

4
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:18,308
The sky is clear

5
00:00:18,476 --> 00:00:22,271
The morning's here

6
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:23,772
Hey!

7
00:00:24,941 --> 00:00:28,527
Do you have to do that?
It's Saturday!

8
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:30,529
Oh, come on!

9
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:32,448
Morning's here!

00:00:32,615 --> 00:00:36,160
[SINGING]
Morning's here

11
00:00:36,327 --> 00:00:38,537
The morning's here

12
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:41,582
Sunshine is here

13
00:00:44,377 --> 00:00:46,420
I hate this apartment!

14
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:52,092
I hate the color of these walls!
I hate that this place still smells like bird!

15
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:56,013
I hate that singing guy!

16
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:59,600
Are you kidding? I love that guy!

17
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:03,187
[SINGS]
Morning's here, morning is...

18
00:01:03,354 --> 00:01:05,147
Stop it!

19
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:07,566
I will kill you.

20
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:12,738
I hate that my room is so small.

21
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:15,616
I have all the space I need.
Just do what I did.

22
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:19,661
Monica, you don't even have a bed.
You sleep in a ball on the floor!

23
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:23,749
You know what?
I am tired of your bellyaching.

24
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:27,252
I've worked really hard at making this
a nice place for us to live.

25
00:01:27,837 --> 00:01:29,713
I know. I'm so sorry.

26
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:31,757
I'm sorry, okay?

27
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:33,258
This is a great apartment.

28
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:35,344
Shut up. This place is a hole.

29
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:34,153
Oh, blimey, I still can't believe
you've got an earring!

30
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,406
I know, I know.
Who am I? David Bowie?

31
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:40,826
He does that?

32
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:43,078
- I don't know. Whatever.
- Ha, ha.

33
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:46,290
Well, I think it makes you look
really dangerous.

34
00:02:46,457 --> 00:02:48,750
- Oh, I know.
- Ha-ha-ha.

35
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:50,544
You know what?

36
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:53,547
I never would've gotten this
if it weren't for you.

37
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:57,259
No, really. When I'm with you, I'm like...

38
00:02:57,427 --> 00:03:00,179
...this whole other guy.
I love that guy!

39
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,514
I mean, I love you too. A lot.

40
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:04,933
But that guy!

41
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:06,518
I love that guy!

42
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:08,520
- I love both of you.
- Ah, heh.

43
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:13,692
I wish I didn't have to go.

44
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:15,777
Then don't.

45
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:18,655
Stay here. Don't go so soon to London.

46
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:20,199
- Just one more day.
- Oh, Ross.

47
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:22,618
- One more day.
- Please don't do this to me again.

48
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:27,497
You know I'd stay, but I've already missed
so much work. They'll fire me.

49
00:03:27,665 --> 00:03:30,876
So? Then you could stay
as long as you want.

50
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:33,295
I wish I could.

51
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:37,466
Oh, no, don't... Don't...
Don't start packing.

52
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:39,426
Come on.

53
00:03:42,096 --> 00:03:43,972
I don't think you understand packing.

54
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:48,101
I don't want to leave it
till the last minute.

55
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:50,896
Last time I packed in a rush,
I left my knickers here.

56
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:53,982
Yeah, I know. I, uh, tried them on.

57
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:56,026
You didn't!

58
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:58,737
No, I didn't.
I didn't want to be "that guy."

[GRUNTING]

60
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:09,456
Hello.

61
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:12,292
Ho, ho, ho.

62
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,421
- Excuse me?
- Your pants.

63
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,840
Oh, yeah! You like them?

64
00:04:19,008 --> 00:04:22,469
I went to a used-clothes store
and got maternity stuff.

65
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:25,514
These are so comfortable.

66
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:27,307
[LAUGHS]

67
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:31,603
Uh, Pheebs, those are,
uh, Santa pants.

68
00:04:32,563 --> 00:04:34,898
- What?
- Santa pants.

69
00:04:35,858 --> 00:04:37,609
Santa Claus' pants.

70
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:41,446
Nuh-uh. They're maternity pants.

71
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:44,992
They even came with
a list of baby names. See?

72
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:48,245
These names are good,
and these are bad.

73
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:51,748
Oh.

74
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:54,584
- Hey!
- Hey.

75
00:04:54,752 --> 00:04:56,044
RACHEL:
Hey, Pheebs.

76
00:04:56,587 --> 00:04:58,880
So, how are the elves?

77
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:04,386
I don't know.
How are the, uh, you know?

78
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:08,015
Your clothes aren't funny.

79
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:12,144
Hey, guys,
what should I wear to a Knicks game?

80
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:15,147
Uh, a T-shirt that says,
"I Don't Belong Here"?

81
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,483
You have tickets?

82
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:23,030
Mom got Dad's season tickets in
the divorce, so she gave them to me.

83
00:05:23,197 --> 00:05:25,407
Apparently, they're good seats.

84
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:27,951
Oh, my God!
Those are almost on the floor!

85
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:29,828
Do you guys want these?

86
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:32,372
- Yeah!
- Yeah, we do!

87
00:05:32,915 --> 00:05:34,291
Well, you got them!

88
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:36,668
- All right!
- Just give us our apartment back.

89
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:42,716
Whoa, I didn't see that coming.

90
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:45,635
Are you serious?

91
00:05:45,803 --> 00:05:49,598
Come on. We know what these are worth.

92
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:51,850
Do you think we're stupid?

93
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:55,395
Not stupid. You're meaner
than I thought.

94
00:05:56,397 --> 00:05:57,939
- What do you say?
- Forget it.

95
00:05:58,107 --> 00:06:02,027
Okay? I'm not giving up my
bachelor pad for basketball seats.

96
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:04,613
Your "bachelor pad"?

97
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:06,782
Have you even had a girl here?

98
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:10,952
No.

99
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:15,207
But Joey has, and I usually
talk to them in the morning time.

100
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:19,169
Yeah, you do.

101
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:26,885
Come on!

102
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:30,222
Gunther, can I get
two cups of chino, please?

103
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,807
Good one.

104
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:34,684
Come on. Season tickets.

105
00:06:34,852 --> 00:06:37,062
Season tickets!
You know what that means?

106
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,272
Forget it.
I'm not giving up the apartment.

107
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,193
When I was a kid, my dad's company
gave season tickets...

108
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:48,281
...to the Number 1 salesman every year.
All right? My dad never won.

109
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:52,619
Of course, he wasn't in sales.
But still, I never forgot that!

110
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:55,789
- Hey guys!
- Hey.

111
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:59,126
Oh, my God.

112
00:06:59,877 --> 00:07:02,212
We don't make enough
fun of you already?

113
00:07:03,297 --> 00:07:05,757
Oh, yeah. Emily convinced me to do it.

114
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:09,094
You do know that Wham broke up?

115
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:11,721
Ah! Ha, ha.

116
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:15,517
I like it. And Emily likes it.
And that's what counts.

117
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:19,729
So, uh, how are you guys doing?

118
00:07:19,897 --> 00:07:23,316
Don't try and talk all normal
with that thing in your ear.

119
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:25,861
Where's Emily?

120
00:07:26,028 --> 00:07:28,196
Ugh, she's saying goodbye
to her uncle.

121
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:32,075
- Didn't she, like, just get here?
- Yeah! Yeah.

122
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:33,410
Easy, tiger.

123
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:36,037
I just hate this so much.

124
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:40,125
Every time I go pick her up at
the airport, it's so great.

125
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:45,130
But I'm thinking, "I'll be right back
in a couple of days, dropping her off."

126
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:47,883
- So, what'll you do?
- There's nothing to do.

127
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:49,759
She lives there. I live here.

128
00:07:49,927 --> 00:07:52,596
She'd have to move here.

129
00:07:52,763 --> 00:07:54,473
She should move here.

130
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:56,475
What?

131
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:59,144
- I can ask her to live with me.
- Are you serious?

132
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:02,564
- Why not? I mean, why not?
- You've only known her six weeks!

133
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:06,776
I've got a carton of milk in my fridge
I've had a longer relationship with.

134
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:11,031
Look, guys, when I'm with her,
it's like...

135
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:15,035
Uh, she brings out this great side of me.

136
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:17,621
I mean, I love her, you know?

137
00:08:17,788 --> 00:08:19,748
And I love the milk!

138
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:23,877
But I won't ask some British girl
to move in with me.

139
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:30,800
Joey, you say things now.

140
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:34,804
Look, Ross. He's right.
Emily's great.

141
00:08:34,972 --> 00:08:36,264
She's great!

142
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:39,184
But this is too soon.
You're only gonna scare her.

143
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:41,520
- I don't wanna do that.
JOEY: No.

144
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:44,814
You don't want to wreck it.
Don't go too fast.

145
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:47,651
No. You're right.
I know, you're right.

146
00:08:47,818 --> 00:08:49,653
I'm not going to do it.

147
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:53,365
- Thanks guys.
- No problem.

148
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,825
Just remember to wake us up
before you go-go.

149
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:09,923
It's too hard. Too hard!

150
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:13,677
All right, boys.
Last chance for the tickets.

151
00:09:13,844 --> 00:09:17,430
Otherwise, I give them to my
new boyfriend, Joshua.

152
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:20,642
No, thank you.

153
00:09:21,018 --> 00:09:24,229
Wait, wait. Come on, come on!
Let's trade.

154
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:26,856
The timing's perfect!
I just clogged the toilet!

155
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:34,030
I want those seats as much as you.
But we can't live in the small apartment...

156
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:37,117
...after we've lived here!
Ever read Flowers for Algernon?

157
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:38,994
Yes.

158
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:41,079
Ever read Sports Illustrated?

159
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:45,166
No, I didn't read yours!

160
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:46,918
We can go to the game tonight!

161
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:49,671
The only way I'll consider this...

162
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:52,132
...is if they offer more
than just season seats.

163
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,758
- It's the Knicks!
- Screw the Knicks.

164
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:55,552
Whoa!

165
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:02,601
I didn't mean that. I just meant...

166
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:05,770
...that the apartment is worth
so much more.

167
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:08,148
Huh.

168
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:10,984
And the Knicks rule all.

169
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:12,611
Yeah, the Knicks rule all!

170
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:15,947
Hey, so? Are you going to do it?

171
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:20,410
No, we're not going to
because it's not an even trade.

172
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:21,703
All right, look.

173
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:24,914
What if you could keep the apartment
