Hey, um, what's this?

00:00:17,642 --> 00:00:20,227
Oh, a hunk of sandwich from last year.

Oh, Geller's got one hooked.
Oh! Looks like a big one. Oh! Oh!

It's the classic struggle between man...

Hey, you know what's gonna be great
about the fishing trip?

When my dad gives me that, "Joey,
what are you doing with your life?" stuff...

with Charlton Heston, Dad.

- What are you doing with your life?"
- Aw.

You don't have to stop having fun
just because I'm here.

Kathy didn't cheat on all of you.

Well, except you.

00:01:10,278 --> 00:01:12,404
I don't think you should
leave Chandler alone.

It's only been two days
since he broke up with Kathy.

21
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:16,742
You can go fishing next week.

There's nothing I can do right now.
He's still in his sweatpants.

That's only phase one.

You know? I'll be back for phase two.
I would never miss phase two.

25

What's phase two?

26
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:30,506
Getting drunk and going to a strip club.

27
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:35,260
How does going to a strip club
make him better?

28

There are naked ladies there.

29
00:01:37,847 --> 00:01:41,016
It helps him get to phase three,
picturing yourself with other women.

- There are naked ladies there too.
- Yeah.

Would you give me one minute, please?

I was wondering, my niece, you see,

Anyway, I have tickets for the opera.

keep her company this evening.

I mean, when I stuck that dollar bill
in her G-string and grazed her thigh...

329
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:13,818
Phase three!

330
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:15,736
I just achieved phase three!

331
00:19:16,071 --> 00:19:17,071
Really?

332
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:19,740
I am totally picturing you
with all those women.

333
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:25,288
- That's not phase three.
- Well, I'm there too.

334
00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:30,793
- Well, are we all together in a group?
- Stop it, you're killing me.

335
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:32,879
I think I just moved on to phase four.

336
00:19:33,046 --> 00:19:35,923
- Oh, what is that?
- Where I don't want a relationship ever.

337
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:39,594
I just wanna have sex with strippers
and my friends.

338
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:46,893
Come on. Let me see that smile.

339
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:48,227
I don't wanna.

340
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:50,021
Please?

341
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:53,107
I wanted to go to the strip club.

342
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:55,776
You're gonna have plenty of chances,
okay?

343
00:19:55,944 --> 00:19:59,947
There are thousands of women out there
who are just waiting to screw me over.

344
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:03,117
Yeah, all right.

345
00:20:03,952 --> 00:20:05,119
MONICA: Hey.
- Hey.

346
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:07,580
Hey. Ooh, how was Vermont?

347
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:10,708
Emily is incredible.

348
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:13,336
I mean,
there are no words to describe her.

349
00:20:13,503 --> 00:20:17,423
The whole weekend was like a dream.

350
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:21,010
- Oh. And you. Rach. Hey.
- Oh, hey.

351
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:24,680
- You were so right.
- What?

352
00:20:24,848 --> 00:20:27,642
What you said about us
finally being in a place...

353
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:29,769
...where we could really be happy
for each other.

354
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:32,188
- Hmm.
- I mean, I...

355
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:35,775
- I admit, I wasn't quite there.
- Mm-hm.

356
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:39,070
You know, I mean,
the thought of you and that Josh guy...

357
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:43,074
- "Joshua."
- Joshua guy at that club...

358
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:45,409
...dancing, having a good time.

359
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:47,328
And the thought of it kind of...

360
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:49,538
- You know?
- Yeah.

361
00:20:49,706 --> 00:20:53,459
But now, but now, I'm totally there.

362
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:55,878
I'm finally where you are.

363
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:57,797
Oh, thank goodness.

364
00:20:57,965 --> 00:21:01,008
Yeah, and thank you for Emily.

365
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:04,845
Oh, no problem.
I'm so glad I could help, you know?

366
00:21:05,013 --> 00:21:06,889
I'm happy for you.

367
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:08,182
Happy for you.

368
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:11,686
Oh, no, happy for you.

369
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:18,609
All right, ladies,
here's what we're gonna do.

370
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:21,279
You are gonna take off my clothes.

371
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:23,614
You two go get the oils.

372
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:26,117
And you constantly scream
at the top of your voice:

373
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:28,661
"Chandler's the king!
Chandler's the king!"

374
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:31,247
No, I wanna be with her. I like her.

375
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:34,542
Oh, that's fine. Go with your instincts.
Go with your instincts.

376
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:36,043
Wait, what am I doing again?

377
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:39,088
Would you please pay attention?
I could wake up at any moment.

378
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:41,757
Hi, I'm Joshua.
I'm here to pick up Rachel.

379
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:43,759
No, no, no, that's not Joshua.

380
00:21:44,594 --> 00:21:47,054
What do you want from me?
I never met the guy.

381
00:21:48,056 --> 00:21:53,352
So anyway, Rachel, I'm sorry you can't stay.
The rest of us have a lot of work to do.

382
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:58,691
What are you doing?

383
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:01,736
All right, listen, I gotta wake up.

384
00:22:06,074 --> 00:22:08,075
