[ Whimpers ]

332
00:17:55,941 --> 00:17:59,240
What are we gonna do, Homer?
My kids are gonna be traumatized.

333
00:17:59,344 --> 00:18:04,111
- And then there's Maude. And then there's Maude!
- I don't know, Flanders.

334
00:18:04,216 --> 00:18:07,879
Having two wives
could have its advantages.

335
00:18:09,288 --> 00:18:13,486
Chop, chop, dig, dig.
Chop, chop, dig, dig.

336
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:15,583
Chop, chop, dig, dig.

337
00:18:15,694 --> 00:18:18,458
You know, Homey,
there's so much more...

338
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:21,032
two wives could do for you.

339
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:23,795
I hear digging,
but I don't hear chopping.

340
00:18:25,704 --> 00:18:29,868
- [ Buzzing ]
- Ooh! A friendly bee. [ Screams ]

341
00:18:29,975 --> 00:18:33,934
Ow. That sting hurts so much.

342
00:18:34,046 --> 00:18:36,014
- We gotta get out of this, Ned.
- Well, do something.

343
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:39,346
This is all your fault-
You and your stupid program.

344
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:42,477
Blame me if you must,
but don't ever speak ill of the program.

345
00:18:42,588 --> 00:18:45,716
The program is rock solid.
The program is sound.

346
00:18:45,824 --> 00:18:48,952
- Yoo-hoo!
- Oh, those awful women want their omelets.

347
00:18:51,063 --> 00:18:54,999
Oh, how are we gonna get out
of this mess in an honorable and decent-

348
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:57,000
Oh, <i>nuts.!</i>

349
00:18:57,102 --> 00:19:00,128
I don't know.
Omelets have a lot of fat in them.

350
00:19:00,239 --> 00:19:03,174
Forget it. You're married.
Let yourself go.

351
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:05,800

- They're running away.

How could a fat guy
run so fast? Hey!

359
00:19:42,247 --> 00:19:44,272
Aw-

360
00:19:44,383 --> 00:19:46,283
Come on, baby, show Gil a four.

361
00:19:46,385 --> 00:19:48,512
- Craps.
- Oh, no.

362
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:50,884
Why did I bet the company payroll?

363
00:19:50,989 --> 00:19:53,287
Oh, Gil's in a lot of trouble.

364
00:19:54,459 --> 00:19:56,984
- [ Nervous Laugh ]
- Somebody help!

365
00:19:57,095 --> 00:19:59,154
Our husbands are trying to ditch us.

366
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:03,693
Someone dishonoring their
marriage vows? Not in Las Vegas.

367
00:20:03,802 --> 00:20:07,499
Attention, all employees.
We've got two runaways. Stop them.

It's unconscionable.

[ Whimpers, Screams ]
The Moody Blues!

373
00:20:22,955 --> 00:20:25,253
Cold-hearted Homer,
ditching his wife...

374
00:20:25,357 --> 00:20:28,224
while ancient Ned runs for his life.

375
00:20:28,327 --> 00:20:32,593
Chips of red and blue and white,
but we decide which-

376
00:20:32,698 --> 00:20:34,859
Can the poems. It's ass-whooping time.

377
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:37,299
- I want fatty.
- [ Screams ]

378
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:40,428
- Get him! Get him!
- Let's get him.

379
00:20:47,446 --> 00:20:49,573
What if we switched wives?
Would that help?

380
00:20:49,681 --> 00:20:53,344

Las Vegas doesn't care
for out-of-towners.

385
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:09,767
Take your money
and go someplace else.

386

- [ Crowd ] Yeah!
- I really disrespect them.

387
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:14,629
And don't you ever
try to marry us again.

- We were out buying them fabulous gifts-
- What's the occasion?

393
00:21:30,188 --> 00:21:33,214
Because we love them,jackass.

- Homer!
- You're right, you're right.

Fifty spaceships beamed us aboard.

397

and saved America.

Uh, do I have to be gang-probed?

400
00:21:47,673 --> 00:21:49,573
Would you rather
tell Maude the truth?
