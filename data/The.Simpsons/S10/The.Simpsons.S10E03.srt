I know that's hard to understand.

334
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:23,833
Mmm.
Not as hard as you think.

335
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:31,538
- Run for it.
- Really?

336
00:18:36,748 --> 00:18:39,308
Okay, that's exactly one moment.

337
00:18:39,418 --> 00:18:42,046
And- Oh, my God!
He's getting away!

338
00:18:42,154 --> 00:18:44,418
- [ Gasping, Murmuring ]
- Stop him!

339
00:18:44,523 --> 00:18:47,583
- Out of the way, Midge.
- Oh, am I in the way?

340
00:18:47,693 --> 00:18:51,026
Yes, yes, you're in the way!
Are you daft, woman?

341
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,690
Sorry.
I didn't realize I was in the way.

342
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:56,700
You're still in the way.
You don't seem to be moving at all.

343
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:59,270
Oh, for cryin' out loud,
just knock her ass down.

344
00:18:59,371 --> 00:19:01,464
- [ Moe ] Way to shove, Edna.
- [ Apu ] Let us roll.

345
00:19:01,573 --> 00:19:03,973
Guys, is it really true?

346
00:19:04,076 --> 00:19:06,101
Are you cold-blooded egg murderers?

347
00:19:07,846 --> 00:19:11,304
Don't use that look on me.
I invented that look.

348
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,882
There he is, off in the distance!

349
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:19,048
- [ Whimpering, Panting ]
- <i>[ Smithers ] He's getting away.!</i>

350
00:19:21,593 --> 00:19:24,118
- [ Gasps ]
- Okay, Bart.

351
00:19:24,229 --> 00:19:27,130
This is where it ends.
Relinquish the lizards.

352
00:19:27,232 --> 00:19:30,360
- [ Gasping ]
- I said relinquish.

353
00:19:30,469 --> 00:19:32,994
- Aah!
- [ Both Grunting ]

354
00:19:33,105 --> 00:19:35,767
- [ Marge Gasps ]
- [ Grunting Continues ]

355
00:19:35,874 --> 00:19:38,707
Oh! Oh, no!

356
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:42,412
You killed 'em!

357
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:45,381
- [ Groans ]
- Good riddance to bad lizards.

358
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:54,885
Hmm? Hey! Whoa!
Look at 'em!

359
00:19:54,993 --> 00:19:56,893
Go, Chirpy Boy!
Go, BartJunior!

360
00:19:56,995 --> 00:19:58,758
Oh, nuts!

361
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:01,890
Wow. Did you know they had
those webbed flaps for gliding?

362
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,628
Yes. But I was hoping
they didn't know that.

363
00:20:10,609 --> 00:20:13,169
Well, I hope you're happy, Bart.

364
00:20:13,278 --> 00:20:17,840
You have no idea what kind of plague
you've unleashed upon this town.

365
00:20:19,351 --> 00:20:21,251
Our top story:

366
00:20:21,353 --> 00:20:24,584
The population of parasitic
tree lizards has exploded...

367
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:27,158
and local citizens
couldn't be happier.

368
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:31,093
It seems the rapacious reptiles have
developed a taste for the common pigeon...

369
00:20:31,196 --> 00:20:34,290
also known as the feathered rat,
or gutterbird.

370
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:37,300
For the first time, citizens
need not fear harassment...

371
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:39,962
by flocks of chattering disease-bags.

372
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:47,143
For decimating
our pigeon population...

373
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:49,840
and making Springfield
a less oppressive place...

374
00:20:49,948 --> 00:20:52,348
to while away our worthless lives...

375
00:20:52,451 --> 00:20:56,217
I present you
with this scented candle.

376
00:20:56,321 --> 00:21:00,018
- [ All Cheering ]
- Yeah! All right!

377
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:02,958
Well, I was wrong.
The lizards are a godsend.

378
00:21:03,061 --> 00:21:05,188
But isn't that a bit shortsighted?

379
00:21:05,297 --> 00:21:08,664
- What happens when we're overrun by lizards?
- No problem.

380
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:12,225
We simply unleash wave after wave
of Chinese needle snakes.

381
00:21:12,337 --> 00:21:15,500
- They'll wipe out the lizards.
- But aren't the snakes even worse?

382
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:17,507
Yes, but we're prepared for that.

383
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:20,578
We've lined up a fabulous type of gorilla
that thrives on snake meat.

384
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:23,580
- Then we're stuck with gorillas!
- No, that's the beautiful part.

385
00:21:23,682 --> 00:21:26,879
When wintertime rolls around,
the gorillas simply freeze to death.

386
00:21:26,985 --> 00:21:28,885
Hmm.

387
00:21:28,987 --> 00:21:32,081
I'm proud of you, boy.

388
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:35,648
[ Sniffs ]
Mmm. Loganberry.

389
00:21:35,761 --> 00:21:38,286
I don't get it, Bart.

390
00:21:38,397 --> 00:21:41,298
You got all upset
when you killed one bird...

391
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:44,665
but now you've killed tens of thousands
and it doesn't bother you at all.

392
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:46,704
Hey, you're right.

393
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:49,706
- I call the front seat!
- You had it on the way over!

394
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:51,708
- Hey!
- [ Both Grunting ]

395
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,937
<i>[ Bart ]</i>
<i>Out of my way.! Oww.!</i>

396
00:22:40,425 --> 00:22:42,393
- [ Murmuring ]
- Shh!
