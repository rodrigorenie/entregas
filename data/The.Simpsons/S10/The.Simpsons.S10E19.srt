People of Springfield,
behold my latest work!

332
00:19:37,209 --> 00:19:39,905
Homer, what have you done?

333
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:43,413
It's conceptual art-
<i>The Grand Canals of Springfield.</i>

334
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:45,608
Just like Venice,
without the black plague.

335
00:19:45,717 --> 00:19:49,084
- What do you think?
- I think some people are going to be upset.

336
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:51,156
I love it, Homer!

337
00:19:51,256 --> 00:19:53,690
You've turned this town
into a work of art!

338
00:19:53,792 --> 00:19:58,388
I just wish JasperJohns
hadn't stolen my boat. Aah!

339
00:19:58,497 --> 00:20:00,465
<i>So long, suckers.!</i>

340
00:20:00,566 --> 00:20:04,525
Well, they're in the business.
Real people might not be so understanding.

341
00:20:04,636 --> 00:20:08,697
<i>What the flood?</i>
<i>Maude, it's a miracle.!</i>

342
00:20:08,807 --> 00:20:12,038
The Lord has drowned the wicked
and spared the righteous.

343
00:20:12,144 --> 00:20:14,669
[ Gasps ]
Isn't that Homer Simpson?

344
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:19,046
[ Scoffs ] Looks like heaven's easier
to get into than Arizona State.

345
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:24,010
Ohh! I hate these flood pants.

346
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:29,127
Hey, they're working!

347
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:32,254
My feet are soaked,
but my cuffs are bone-dry!

348
00:20:32,364 --> 00:20:35,265
Everything's comin' up Milhouse!

349
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:40,371
<i>[ Men, Women ]</i>
<i>Ahh.!</i>

350
00:20:40,472 --> 00:20:46,308
<i>##[ Man Singing Love Song ]</i>

351
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:54,945
Edna, I'm gonna pop you a question...

352
00:20:55,053 --> 00:20:58,284
and... I hope the answer is yes.

353
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:00,654
Do you think mother
would like this hat pin?

354
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:02,727
Oh. Yes.

355
00:21:02,828 --> 00:21:05,820
Oh, you've made me
the happiest man on Earth!

356
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:17,335
Well, Homer, I have to admit...

357
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:20,275
you created something
people really love.

358
00:21:20,379 --> 00:21:22,347
You truly are an artist.

359
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:26,042
No. I'm just a nut
who couldn't build a barbecue.

360
00:21:26,151 --> 00:21:28,881
You'll always be the artist
in the family.

361
00:21:28,987 --> 00:21:31,114
- Aww.
- Is that our house?

362
00:21:31,223 --> 00:21:33,487
- Yep.
- And is that us on the roof?

363
00:21:33,592 --> 00:21:36,857
- That's us.
- Are we kissing?

364
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:39,624
Oh, I don't know.
Could be.

365
00:21:39,731 --> 00:21:42,029
I need some inspiration.

366
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:46,604

367
00:21:51,276 --> 00:21:53,176
