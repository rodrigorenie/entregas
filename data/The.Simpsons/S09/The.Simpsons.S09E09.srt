Well, like we say,
"The right house for the right person."

Listen, it's time I let you in
on a little secret, Marge.

186
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,838
The right house
is the house that's for sale.

The right person is anyone.

188

But all I did
was tell the truth.

189

Of course you did.
But there's the <i>truth...</i>

190

- Let me show you.

Ooh, I remember.

198
00:11:51,977 --> 00:11:54,571
Mrs. Astor was very lucky.

199
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:57,513
Well, no one expects you
to sell that house.

200
00:11:57,616 --> 00:11:59,846
But you'd better
sell something.

201
00:11:59,952 --> 00:12:02,785
Because cubicles
are for closers, Marge.

202

Anybody who doesn't sell a house
their first week gets fired.

Ah, so you don't have

[Scoffs]
So that's how you see me?

210
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:32,941

Mm-hmm.

Well, I can too compete.
And I'm going to sell a house. End of story.

[Groans]

220
00:13:02,248 --> 00:13:06,344
Well, nothing's perfect. I sure hate to make you
come out here and not buy a house.

Now, slow down, Neddie.
The home buyer's course...

Well, there it is.

224
00:13:16,762 --> 00:13:19,060
Please don't tell anyone
how I live.

225
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:23,033
Hmm. It's awfully small.

226
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:25,695
Some people
would call it cozy.

227
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:30,037
- I guess it is sorta cute.
- But small. Really, really small.

228
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:34,545

it does seem a bit small.

Wait.

slashed repeatedly.

bloody murder, and no one would hear.

- Sure, Marge. "Was."

where he dropped the dagger.

330
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,653
And this is the butler's pantry,
where Mrs. Astor concealed herself.

331
00:19:51,757 --> 00:19:54,191
And right here's where
they found the torso heap-

332
00:19:54,293 --> 00:19:56,761
in front of
our very own fireplace!

333
00:19:56,862 --> 00:20:00,389
Oh, just think, Neddie.
We're part of Springfield history.

334
00:20:00,499 --> 00:20:05,095
- Look, Daddy. I'm the jealous jockey.
- I'm a torso.

335
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:08,765
I'm glad you're not mad.
But I lied to you...

336
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:11,866
and I won't feel right
until I return your deposit.

337
00:20:11,977 --> 00:20:16,710
We appreciate the offer, Marge,
but I think we're gonna be very happy here.

338
00:20:16,815 --> 00:20:19,409
- [Grunting]
- [All Screaming]

339
00:20:19,518 --> 00:20:21,042
[Both Screaming]

340
00:20:22,754 --> 00:20:25,587
- [Siren Wailing]
- [Screaming]

341
00:20:31,263 --> 00:20:35,791
Uh, Marge- [Chuckles]
you still got that deposit check?

342
00:20:39,171 --> 00:20:42,197
- Oh! Oh, wow.
- [Groaning]

343
00:20:42,307 --> 00:20:45,105
- Lucky thing we landed on this bubble wrap.
- [Popping]

344
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:49,442
- Hey, quit hoggir.
- Oh, I'm badly hurt.

345
00:20:49,548 --> 00:20:53,951
A smashed hotrod, a wrecked police cruiser,
a destroyed house!

346
00:20:54,052 --> 00:20:56,247
I've had it with
your renegade ways, Simpson.

347
00:20:56,355 --> 00:20:58,346
- You're a loose cannon.
- But l-

348
00:20:58,457 --> 00:21:01,551
And what really fries me
is you returned his check!

349
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:05,528
I'm sorry, Mr. Hutz,
but I just can't lie to people.

350
00:21:05,631 --> 00:21:07,531
[Laughing]

351
00:21:07,633 --> 00:21:09,658
You're one of a kind, Marge...

352
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:12,896
and nobody deserves this
more than you.

353
00:21:14,239 --> 00:21:16,707
[Groans]

354
00:21:16,808 --> 00:21:20,642
Well, I'm proud of you, Mom.
You refused to compromise your integrity.

355
00:21:20,746 --> 00:21:23,681
Yeah. You did the right thing,
eventually.

356
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:27,548
Still, it would've been nice
to bring home at least one paycheck.

357
00:21:27,653 --> 00:21:30,281
Oh, you will, honey.

358
00:21:30,389 --> 00:21:32,516
You will.

359
00:21:36,662 --> 00:21:39,654
$300 for doing nothing?

360
00:21:39,765 --> 00:21:41,790
I feel like such a crook.

361
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:44,960
Don't worry.
Gets easier every week.

362
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:47,402
[Kisses]

363
00:22:38,657 --> 00:22:40,625
- [Murmuring]
- Shh!
