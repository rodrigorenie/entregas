1
00:00:06,103 --> 00:00:07,681
Another Simpsons Clip Show

2
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:41,462
This romance is
so full of heartfelt passion.

3
00:00:41,639 --> 00:00:45,423
I can really identify with
this corn-fed heroine.

4
00:00:45,643 --> 00:00:47,386
Homer, are you awake?

5
00:00:47,561 --> 00:00:49,933
This is important.
Give me some sign you're awake.

6
00:00:50,981 --> 00:00:53,389
- Wake up!
- What's wrong?

7
00:00:53,567 --> 00:00:55,726
House run away? Dog's on fire?

8
00:00:55,903 --> 00:00:59,486
Homie, do you think that the romance
has gone out of our lives?

9
00:01:00,407 --> 00:01:02,530
Wake up!

10
00:01:02,701 --> 00:01:05,323
Marge, it's 3 a.m.,
and I worked all day.

11
00:01:05,537 --> 00:01:08,280
It's 9:30 p.m., and you spent
your whole Saturday...

12
00:01:08,207 --> 00:01:10,449
...drinking beer
in Maggie's kiddie pool.

13
00:01:11,543 --> 00:01:13,666
There you are.

14
00:01:13,837 --> 00:01:15,296
Thought you could get away, huh?

15
00:01:15,506 --> 00:01:17,831
Homer, young people learn
about love from adults.

16
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:22,255
We've been setting a terrible example
for our children and the community.

17
00:01:22,429 --> 00:01:26,379
I want us to deal with the issues
raised by this book.

18
00:01:29,436 --> 00:01:31,844
We shouldn't have put
a fireplace in the bedroom.

19
00:02:05,264 --> 00:02:08,384
How many times can you laugh
at that cat getting hit by the moon?

20
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,929
It's a new episode.

21
00:02:10,102 --> 00:02:12,854
Not exactly. They pieced it
together from old shows.

22
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:16,437
And it seems new to the trusting eyes
of impressionable youth.

23
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:19,485
- Really?
- Ren & Stimpy do it all the time.

24
00:02:19,695 --> 00:02:23,230
Yes, and when was the last you heard
anyone talk about Ren & Stimpy?

25
00:02:23,407 --> 00:02:26,823
Children, your father and I
have fed you and clothed you...

26
00:02:26,994 --> 00:02:29,781
...but we've neglected
something more important.

27
00:02:29,997 --> 00:02:32,120
It's time to learn about love.

28
00:02:32,333 --> 00:02:34,206
No need. We already learned in school.

29
00:02:34,585 --> 00:02:36,376
This is Fuzzy Bunny.

30
00:02:36,587 --> 00:02:41,462
About a year ago he noticed his voice
was changing. He had terrible acne...

31
00:02:41,633 --> 00:02:47,588
...and had fur where there was no fur
before. He also noticed Fluffy Bunny.

32
00:02:47,806 --> 00:02:49,598
Boring.

33
00:02:49,808 --> 00:02:53,853
Fuzzy went to the park,
the ice-cream social, the boat show...

34
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:58,350
...and other wholesome activities.
They never ruined their fun...

35
00:02:58,525 --> 00:03:01,894
...by giving in to their throbbing
biological urges.

36
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:04,280
Then came the big day.

37
00:03:04,198 --> 00:03:09,109
Fluffy and Fuzzy got married.
That night came the honeymoon.

38
00:03:10,996 --> 00:03:12,372
She's faking it.

39
00:03:12,581 --> 00:03:15,831
I mean romance, not love.

40
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:17,288
Mom, romance is dead.

41
00:03:17,503 --> 00:03:20,504
It was acquired in a hostile takeover
by Hallmark and Disney...

42
00:03:20,714 --> 00:03:23,419
...homogenized and sold off
piece by piece.

43
00:03:23,634 --> 00:03:28,110
That's not true! Romance is
all around us, in our neighborhoods.

44
00:03:29,306 --> 00:03:31,465
Even at our jobs.

45
00:03:41,193 --> 00:03:45,570
All you have to do is think about
your most cherished memories.

46
00:03:46,824 --> 00:03:49,660
- Moe's Tavern.
- Hello, is Al there?

47
00:03:49,243 --> 00:03:51,994
- AI?
- Yeah, Al. Last name, Coholic.

48
00:03:52,204 --> 00:03:53,579
Let me check.

49
00:03:53,789 --> 00:03:56,410
Phone call for Al.
Al Coholic.

50
00:03:56,625 --> 00:03:58,701
Jock Strap.

51
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:00,710
Is I.P. Freely here?

52
00:04:00,921 --> 00:04:04,504
Hey, is there a Butts here?
Seymour Butts?

53
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:07,792
Homer Sexual!
Mike Rotch!

54
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,636
Amanda Huggenkiss!

55
00:04:09,847 --> 00:04:12,890
Hugh Jass.
Ivana Tinkle.

56
00:04:12,308 --> 00:04:15,593
I'm a stupid moron with an ugly face
and a big butt...

57
00:04:15,811 --> 00:04:19,595
...and my butt smells
and I like to kiss my own butt.

58
00:04:19,815 --> 00:04:21,190
No, no!

59
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:25,570
No, ask your heart
what its fondest desire is.

60
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,446
Chocolate.

61
00:04:31,327 --> 00:04:33,449
Invisible cola.

62
00:04:34,246 --> 00:04:36,535
Forbidden donut.

63
00:04:37,791 --> 00:04:39,701
"Sacrilicious."

64
00:04:41,211 --> 00:04:42,374
Snouts.

65
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:44,375
Free goo.

66
00:04:45,549 --> 00:04:47,800
Something.

67
00:04:47,259 --> 00:04:49,252
No, think about people...

68
00:04:49,428 --> 00:04:53,342
...about moments in your life
that have been very romantic.

69
00:04:53,557 --> 00:04:54,588
Oh, okay.

70
00:04:57,853 --> 00:05:01,637
That's not the idea at all.

71
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:08,105
Okay. Well, this story isn't ideal.
I've never told it to you before.

72
00:05:08,447 --> 00:05:12,860
I got a thoughtless birthday present from
someone who shall remain nameless.

73
00:05:16,497 --> 00:05:18,822
I went to the bowling alley
to spite him. Or her.

74
00:05:31,178 --> 00:05:34,713
- I'm awfully sorry.
- Entirely my fault.

75
00:05:34,932 --> 00:05:36,556
It is nice to meet you...

76
00:05:37,851 --> 00:05:39,346
...Homer.

77
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:44,514
No, no. Homer is my
ball's name. I'm Marge.

78
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:54,112
Your fingers are slender, so feminine.
They're too tapered for this ball.

79
00:05:54,284 --> 00:05:57,653
You need something lighter,
more delicate.

80
00:05:57,871 --> 00:06:02,747
- Here, use my ball.
- No, thank you, Mister... Brunswick.

81
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,202
- Call me Jacques.
- Jacques.

82
00:06:05,421 --> 00:06:06,796
Marge.

83
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,998
May I ask you a bold question?

84
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:11,967
- Sure.
- You've never bowled?

85
00:06:12,136 --> 00:06:13,464
- Never.
- No.

86
00:06:13,679 --> 00:06:15,968
- No.
- Then I will teach you.

87
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:19,343
- I don't want to trouble you.
- Not at all. I'm a professional.

88
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,766
Roll the ball, Marge.
Let me see your form.

89
00:06:21,937 --> 00:06:24,938
All right.
But I'm not very good.

90
00:06:27,901 --> 00:06:31,401
I can hit the one pin, but
the rest of them don't even wobble.

91
00:06:31,572 --> 00:06:33,730
I can help you, Marge.
Pick up the ball.

92
00:06:33,949 --> 00:06:36,238
Pick up Homer. Pick him up.

93
00:06:38,412 --> 00:06:39,906
- Now throw.
- But...

94
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,156
Throw, damn you.

95
00:06:46,628 --> 00:06:49,360
You're a very good teacher.

96
00:06:50,466 --> 00:06:53,870
- Here we are.
- You didn't have to drop me off.

97
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:54,671
But I wanted to.

98
00:06:54,845 --> 00:06:58,925
Marge, do you know how beautiful
you look in the moonlight?

99
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:02,551
- Jacques, I'm a married woman.
- I know, I know.

100
00:07:02,728 --> 00:07:08,102
My mind says stop, but my heart
and my hips cry, "Proceed!"

101
00:07:09,401 --> 00:07:11,608
Darling, I want to see you tomorrow.

102
00:07:11,779 --> 00:07:14,200
- Meet me tomorrow for brunch.
- What's brunch?

103
00:07:14,239 --> 00:07:16,730
You'd love it. It's not quite
breakfast or lunch...

104
00:07:16,909 --> 00:07:19,945
...but it comes with a slice of
cantaloupe at the end.

105
00:07:20,162 --> 00:07:23,863
You don't get what you would at
breakfast, but you get a good meal.

106
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:26,283
He seemed to know a lot
about brunch.

107
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:29,496
But it turned out he wasn't
interested in brunch at all.

108
00:07:30,965 --> 00:07:35,461
Your laughter is like music but if you
laugh at what I say next, I will die.

109
00:07:35,636 --> 00:07:39,420
For I am about to say something
very serious, perhaps shocking.

110
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:43,910
Marge, my darling, I want
you to meet with me again.

111
00:07:43,268 --> 00:07:46,519
- That doesn't shock me.
- Away from prying eyes.

112
00:07:46,689 --> 00:07:50,140
At my apartment, the Fiesta Terrace.

113
00:07:52,569 --> 00:07:54,811
Marge, speak to me!

114
00:07:55,572 --> 00:07:57,446
Is Thursday okay?

115
00:08:10,921 --> 00:08:13,377
Thank goodness I drove
down that ironic street.

116
00:08:14,717 --> 00:08:19,462
I made the right decision to stay with
my Homie, and there was no harm done.

117
00:08:20,723 --> 00:08:24,423
So if you mentally snip out the part
where I already had a husband...

118
00:08:24,601 --> 00:08:26,974
...that's my idea of romance.

119
00:08:27,187 --> 00:08:30,224
Marge, I want you
to stop seeing this Jacques.

120
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:31,858
You can let him down gently...

121
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:35,691
...but over the next couple of months,
I want you to break it off.

122
00:08:35,863 --> 00:08:37,440
Okay, Homer.

123
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:39,614
That was a close one, kids.

124
00:08:42,244 --> 00:08:46,242
Okay, Marge. As long as
we're traumatizing the kids...

125
00:08:46,415 --> 00:08:49,416
...I have a scandalous story
of my own.

126
00:08:50,502 --> 00:08:54,200
Gentlemen, I'd like you to meet
your new coworker, Mindy Simmons.

127
00:08:54,173 --> 00:08:56,296
She has a degree in engineering
or something.

128
00:08:56,467 --> 00:08:57,629
Hi. How's it going?

129
00:08:57,843 --> 00:08:59,670
- Oh, pleased to meet you.
- Yeah, ditto.

130
00:08:59,887 --> 00:09:01,215
Hi.

131
00:09:05,517 --> 00:09:07,225
Homer, what's the matter?

132
00:09:07,394 --> 00:09:10,431
Ain't you never seen a naked chick
riding a clam before?

133
00:09:11,607 --> 00:09:13,660
Gotta go!

134
00:09:17,863 --> 00:09:21,777
I made it the whole day
without seeing her again.

135
00:09:22,618 --> 00:09:25,370
I mean, "Hello!"

136
00:09:25,662 --> 00:09:27,702
I guess we'll be going down together.

137
00:09:27,873 --> 00:09:30,411
- I mean, getting off togeth... I mean...
- That's okay.

138
00:09:30,584 --> 00:09:34,333
I'll just push the button for
the stimulator... I mean, elevator.

139
00:09:34,505 --> 00:09:37,921
Think unsexy thoughts, think unsexy
thoughts, think unsexy thoughts.

140
00:09:46,183 --> 00:09:47,843
Well, this is my floor.

141
00:09:51,522 --> 00:09:52,850
See you tomorrow!

142
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:56,564
I tried to avoid her, but we were
sent to a nuclear convention together.

143
00:10:02,116 --> 00:10:03,776
TV's there. Bathroom's there.

144
00:10:03,951 --> 00:10:06,240
And there's your king-size bed for:

145
00:10:13,836 --> 00:10:15,116
- Hubba-hubba.
- Stop that.

146
00:10:15,296 --> 00:10:18,878
I love my wife and family. All I'll use
this bed for is sleeping, eating...

147
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:21,719
...and maybe building a little fort.
That's it!

148
00:10:21,927 --> 00:10:26,803
Homer, I got a really wicked idea
that could get us into a lot of trouble.

149
00:10:26,974 --> 00:10:31,719
- Mindy. We have to fight our temptation.
- No, Homer.

150
00:10:31,895 --> 00:10:33,555
Let's do it.

151
00:10:33,731 --> 00:10:35,640
Let's call room service!

152
00:10:38,444 --> 00:10:40,650
Someone's charging room service
to the company.

153
00:10:40,863 --> 00:10:43,947
Well, we'll just see about that.

154
00:10:44,617 --> 00:10:48,863
Fly, my pretties. Fly!

155
00:10:54,418 --> 00:10:56,126
Continue the research.

156
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:00,837
Thanks for poisoning the planet,
bastard!

157
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,713
- Get bent!
- No more Chernobyls!

158
00:11:03,886 --> 00:11:06,440
Go to hell!

159
00:11:06,847 --> 00:11:09,890
I was doing my best to resist her...

160
00:11:09,266 --> 00:11:13,134
...but at dinner, the fortune cookie
predicted doom.

161
00:11:15,814 --> 00:11:18,305
"You will find happiness
with a new love."

162
00:11:18,484 --> 00:11:22,481
- This was a really nice night, Homer.
- Yeah, yeah.

163
00:11:24,615 --> 00:11:28,565
- What's wrong?
- Oh, yeah, like you don't know.

164
00:11:28,744 --> 00:11:31,615
We're gonna have sex.

165
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:35,994
- Well, we don't have to.
- Yes, we do.

166
00:11:36,168 --> 00:11:37,995
The cookie told me so.

167
00:11:38,212 --> 00:11:41,248
Well, desserts aren't always right.

168
00:11:41,465 --> 00:11:43,700
But they're so sweet.

169
00:11:43,217 --> 00:11:44,877
Homer...

170
00:11:45,678 --> 00:11:47,884
...you know how I feel.

171
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:50,670
So it's up to you.

172
00:11:51,183 --> 00:11:55,512
Look in your heart.
I think you'll see what you want.

173
00:12:10,494 --> 00:12:12,403
Oh, baby.

174
00:12:13,247 --> 00:12:16,912
This was a wonderful idea, Homie.

175
00:12:17,668 --> 00:12:20,585
- What happened to Mindy?
- Yes, what did happen to her?

176
00:12:20,796 --> 00:12:23,200
She hit the bottle hard
and lost her job.

177
00:12:23,507 --> 00:12:26,958
Good. Does anyone else
have a love story?

178
00:12:27,177 --> 00:12:31,507
Yes, I do. And just like your love stories,
it's tragic and filled with hurt feelings...

179
00:12:31,682 --> 00:12:33,425
...and scars that will never heal.

180
00:12:33,851 --> 00:12:36,556
It started, appropriately enough,
with an innocent boy...

181
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:39,688
...being embarrassed
on Valentine's Day.

182
00:12:44,278 --> 00:12:46,685
Poor Ralph.

183
00:12:47,531 --> 00:12:49,607
Here you go, Ralph.

184
00:12:51,452 --> 00:12:55,449
- You "choo-choo-choose" me?
- Happy Valentine's.

185
00:12:59,918 --> 00:13:02,291
It was an unusually warm
February 14th...

186
00:13:02,504 --> 00:13:04,995
...so the children walked home
without jackets.

187
00:13:05,215 --> 00:13:08,880
Can I walk you home, valentine?

188
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:10,589
Sure, I guess.

189
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:14,465
That valentine sure was funny.

190
00:13:14,642 --> 00:13:16,136
Glad you liked it.

191
00:13:16,352 --> 00:13:22,188
It says "choo-choo-choose" me,
and there's a picture of a train.

192
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:24,890
Yeah, nice gag.

193
00:13:27,154 --> 00:13:28,779
So...

194
00:13:28,989 --> 00:13:32,405
...do you like stuff?

195
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:40,493
The doctor said I wouldn't have so many
nosebleeds if I kept my finger out of it.

196
00:13:40,709 --> 00:13:43,379
Well, here's my house.

197
00:13:50,302 --> 00:13:53,339
Oh, no. It's a package from Ralph.

198
00:13:55,391 --> 00:13:58,308
A Malibu Stacy convertible!

199
00:13:58,519 --> 00:14:02,180
"Look in the tunk."
He must mean "trunk."

200
00:14:04,983 --> 00:14:07,771
Tickets to the Krusty Anniversary Show!

201
00:14:08,195 --> 00:14:11,279
It's the Krusty the Clown
29th Anniversary Show!

202
00:14:15,619 --> 00:14:16,994
Thank you, thank you!

203
00:14:17,413 --> 00:14:21,245
- Lisa, you want a bite of my ice cream?
- No, thanks.

204
00:14:21,458 --> 00:14:23,747
Send it this way, boy.

205
00:14:25,546 --> 00:14:28,796
Nothing gets chocolate out. See?

206
00:14:28,966 --> 00:14:31,255
Now, for my favorite part
of the show...

207
00:14:31,468 --> 00:14:34,469
What does that say?
"Talk to the audience"?

208
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:38,594
Oh, God, this is always death.
All right.

209
00:14:38,809 --> 00:14:41,150
Oh, no. Please don't
show me with Ralph.

210
00:14:42,146 --> 00:14:44,850
- What's your name, son?
- Ralph.

211
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:48,660
- And is this your girlfriend, Ralph?
- Yes!

212
00:14:48,277 --> 00:14:52,321
I love Lisa Simpson! And when
I grow up, I'm going to marry her.

213
00:14:52,531 --> 00:14:54,820
No!

214
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:58,319
Now, you listen to me!
I don't like you! I never liked you!

215
00:14:58,537 --> 00:15:00,613
The only reason I gave you
that valentine...

216
00:15:00,831 --> 00:15:02,954
...is because nobody else would!

217
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:07,289
Watch this. You can actually pinpoint
the second when his heart rips in half.

218
00:15:08,213 --> 00:15:11,997
And now!

219
00:15:15,304 --> 00:15:18,471
Lisa, not all romances
turn out that way.

220
00:15:18,682 --> 00:15:22,466
Bart, do you have a love story
that doesn't end in heartbreak?

221
00:15:22,686 --> 00:15:24,145
Yes, I do.

222
00:15:24,354 --> 00:15:28,550
The only girl I ever loved
invited me up to the tree house.

223
00:15:28,275 --> 00:15:31,276
She had something
very important to tell me.

224
00:15:32,613 --> 00:15:36,290
I'm so happy, I just had to tell someone.

225
00:15:36,241 --> 00:15:37,866
I have a boyfriend.

226
00:15:41,372 --> 00:15:43,495
You won't be needing this.

227
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,499
Wait, that did end in heartbreak.

228
00:15:55,719 --> 00:15:58,175
Thanks for opening up
old wounds, Ma.

229
00:16:08,148 --> 00:16:10,556
Well, as Jerry Lee Lewis would say:

230
00:16:10,776 --> 00:16:14,394
"There's a whole lot of frowning
going on."

231
00:16:18,242 --> 00:16:20,697
Mom, doesn't any love story
have a happy ending?

232
00:16:20,911 --> 00:16:24,991
Of course. Remember when...

233
00:16:25,249 --> 00:16:28,840
...your Aunt Selma got married?

234
00:16:29,628 --> 00:16:32,166
- Good.
- Soon I will kill you.

235
00:16:32,381 --> 00:16:33,875
Wait, wait, that's no good.

236
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:37,377
I know. Your grandfather, remember?

237
00:16:37,553 --> 00:16:39,213
It started on an outing for dinner.

238
00:16:41,974 --> 00:16:43,966
Say, I've got a neat idea.

239
00:16:44,184 --> 00:16:47,304
Why don't you go in and pick up
my mother, and we'll go out to dinner.

240
00:16:47,521 --> 00:16:50,142
I'll be back in a jiffy.

241
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:55,398
That's not my mother.

242
00:16:55,612 --> 00:16:58,103
I'll be back in a jiffy.

243
00:16:59,366 --> 00:17:01,822
Can I come too?

244
00:17:07,333 --> 00:17:11,330
They hit it off right away, but there
were rivals for the fair lady's hand.

245
00:17:11,211 --> 00:17:15,458
My favorite song. This is so nice.

246
00:17:15,674 --> 00:17:19,802
I can't remember when I've felt
this young.

247
00:17:20,387 --> 00:17:22,676
I really can't.

248
00:17:25,893 --> 00:17:28,728
Say, sport, mind if I have
the next dance?

249
00:17:28,938 --> 00:17:31,891
What the...? Don't sneak up on a...
Aren't you...?

250
00:17:32,107 --> 00:17:36,900
No need for the blown gasket, Charlie.
I'll have her back in one piece.

251
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:54,661
But in the end, just when things
looked worst, true love triumphed.

252
00:17:56,882 --> 00:18:00,251
Do you, Jacqueline Bouvier,
take this man...

253
00:18:00,469 --> 00:18:03,636
...to be your lawfully wedded husband?

254
00:18:03,847 --> 00:18:06,932
Oh, Monty, my favorite song.
How did...?

255
00:18:07,142 --> 00:18:10,130
I specifically requested
no romantic music. What...?

256
00:18:10,229 --> 00:18:12,850
Mrs. Bouvier!

257
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:15,936
Mrs. Bouvier!

258
00:18:17,444 --> 00:18:20,660
Mrs. Bouvier!

259
00:18:20,281 --> 00:18:23,732
Honey, are you sure you wanna be
Mrs. Montgomery Burns?

260
00:18:23,951 --> 00:18:28,613
Wouldn't you rather be
Mrs. Abraham J. Simpson?

261
00:18:28,789 --> 00:18:30,200
No.

262
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:34,740
- I don't wanna be either.
- Hot diggety damn!

263
00:18:34,294 --> 00:18:36,453
That's good enough for me.

264
00:18:51,562 --> 00:18:53,389
That doesn't seem like a happy ending.

265
00:18:53,731 --> 00:18:56,850
That seems more like a detached tale
of modern alienation.

266
00:18:57,670 --> 00:19:01,361
I give up. Did anybody learn
anything about love tonight?

267
00:19:01,572 --> 00:19:03,611
Yeah, learned it screws everybody up.

268
00:19:03,824 --> 00:19:07,904
Well, there's that side of it.
But there's also...

269
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,579
Help me out here, Lisa.

270
00:19:09,788 --> 00:19:11,781
Sorry, Mom. I've decided
to save my love...

271
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:16,162
...for someone who's guaranteed
not to reject me. Soon, Cory, soon.

272
00:19:20,382 --> 00:19:23,419
Well, kids, I tried.

273
00:19:23,635 --> 00:19:26,430
- But maybe you're right.
- Wait a minute, Marge.

274
00:19:26,263 --> 00:19:30,308
Love isn't hopeless. Look, maybe
I'm no expert on the subject...

275
00:19:30,517 --> 00:19:33,435
...but there was one time
I got it right.

276
00:19:33,604 --> 00:19:38,562
Artie, I don't know. It was a
beautiful evening. Let's not ruin it.

277
00:19:38,776 --> 00:19:41,183
- Just this.
- Artie, please.

278
00:19:41,362 --> 00:19:46,356
- Come on, kiss me. Please.
- No, really, I mean it! Now stop it!

279
00:19:48,285 --> 00:19:50,954
- I'm sorry, Marge.
- Take me home.

280
00:20:01,965 --> 00:20:06,295
I'd appreciate it if you didn't
tell anybody about my busy hands.

281
00:20:06,512 --> 00:20:09,762
Not so much for myself,
but I'm so respected...

282
00:20:09,973 --> 00:20:14,185
...it would damage the town
to hear it. Good night.

283
00:20:14,395 --> 00:20:15,972
Yeah, right.

284
00:20:21,235 --> 00:20:25,233
Shut up! I'm over as far as I can go!

285
00:20:25,447 --> 00:20:30,193
All right! All right!
I'll walk in the mud!

286
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:32,829
- Homer?
- Marge?

287
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:35,660
- Yeah. You want a ride?
- Sure.

288
00:20:37,709 --> 00:20:42,300
When I got home, I realized
who I should've gone with.

289
00:20:42,214 --> 00:20:44,171
Who?

290
00:20:44,383 --> 00:20:48,879
- Hi, prom date.
- Marge, pour vous.

291
00:20:51,307 --> 00:20:54,889
- Why so glum?
- I got a problem.

292
00:20:56,145 --> 00:21:00,308
Once you stop this car,
I'm gonna hug you and kiss you...

293
00:21:00,524 --> 00:21:02,932
...and I'll never let you go.

294
00:21:03,777 --> 00:21:05,687
Your first kiss.

295
00:21:05,904 --> 00:21:08,111
But not the last.

296
00:21:23,213 --> 00:21:25,586
Homie.

297
00:21:28,844 --> 00:21:33,910
See, kids? That's what I meant
by romance.
