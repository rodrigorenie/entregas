The answer is no.
What's wrong with this country?

Can't a man walk down the street

It's in Cypress Creek,
upstate somewhere.

27
00:01:57,617 --> 00:02:01,144
You took a new job in a strange town
without discussing it with your family?

28
00:02:01,254 --> 00:02:05,247
Of course not.
I wouldn't do that. Why not?

29
00:02:05,358 --> 00:02:07,326
We have roots here, Homer.

30

to hoist myself out of it.

It's called Cypress Creek-

48
00:03:16,663 --> 00:03:20,394

the workers of the Globex Corporation.

rearrange your carefully shelved items...

- Hmm?

Wow.

- Um, to work for you?

What's your real dream? Your real dream!

Um, someday I'd like
to own the Dallas Cowboys.

they'll fill in for any other part of your body.

162

Your job will be to manage
and motivate 'em.

163
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:22,154
Give 'em the benefit of
your years of experience.

164

Don't worry.
That won't take long.

165

Well, it's pretty important.

- I'm having a little trouble with the government.

Oh, those jerks-

Don't get me started
about the government.

What's the problem?

341
00:20:09,308 --> 00:20:11,799
- Well, my family wants
to move back to Springfield.

Let 'em go. You'll stay here with me.
We'll go bowling. What's bothering 'em?

343
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,641
Nothing big.
It's just a lot of little things.

344

Well, you can't argue
with the little things.

Homer, I'm disappointed, but I think you
need to do what's best for your family.

Well, thanks

Someone will tell you upstairs.
