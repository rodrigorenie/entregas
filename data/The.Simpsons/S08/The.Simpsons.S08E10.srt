22

it would explode.

we can't perceive.

that alien.

I don't bring you peace and love.

334
00:20:56,351 --> 00:20:59,115
I bring you fear, famine,
pestilence and-

335
00:20:59,221 --> 00:21:01,189
Time for a booster.

336
00:21:01,289 --> 00:21:05,282
## [Singing Cheerful Song]

## [All Singing Cheerful Song]

338
00:21:23,845 --> 00:21:27,246
You said you'd bring them peace and love,
and it looks like you did it.

339
00:21:27,349 --> 00:21:30,785
I'm proud of you, Homie.

340
00:21:30,886 --> 00:21:34,151
Thanks, Marge.

343
00:21:42,530 --> 00:21:45,499
And so concludes our tale.
I'm Leonard Nimoy.

344
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:49,036
Good night, and keep
watching the skis!

345
00:21:49,137 --> 00:21:51,105
Uh, skies.
