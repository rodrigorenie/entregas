Marge, can't we get some clear plates?
I can't see the TV!

8
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:43,403
Is it really necessary to watch TV
while we're eating?

9

We're getting food all over.

you'd serve us out of one long bowl.

12

You're talking about a trough.
We're not going to eat from a trough.

It's only 5:15.

- Lisa, how was school?
- How was what? What?

17
00:01:25,685 --> 00:01:28,210
- School! School!
- It's not time for school.

[Groans]

<i>- Mind your own business.</i>
- Keep it down in there, everybody!

23
00:01:46,172 --> 00:01:50,108
Homer, is this the way you
pictured married life?

24
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:53,941
Yeah, pretty much, except we drove around
in a van solving mysteries.

25
00:01:54,047 --> 00:01:58,381
Well, I pictured cocktail parties
and candlelit dinners. I pictured napkins.

26
00:01:58,485 --> 00:02:00,919
Homer, I want to throw
a dinner party.

27
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:04,922
Oh, I hate having parties.
The toilet always gets backed up.

28
00:02:05,024 --> 00:02:08,824
I don't care if the sink shoots sludge.
We're having a party.

29

Man, that is flagrant
false advertising!

30
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:24,899
[Gasps] It's just not a dinner party
without a melon baller.

31
00:02:25,011 --> 00:02:28,538
And we'll need a citrus zester,
a ravioli crimper.

32
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:33,142
Ooh, an oyster mallet.

Wouldn't it be perfect
for the dinner party?

37
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:54,765
Oh, we can't afford that.
Who do you think I am, Liz Taylor?

38
00:02:54,874 --> 00:02:58,970
Well, maybe we could use
it once and then return it.

- Are you ready?

Just gotta put my shoes on.

50

Mom, Reverend Lovejoy doesn't
have a coat. Should I let him in?

55

My coat was stolen
at last week's interfaith banquet.

56
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:12,275
So I helped myself to a few
of the better umbrellas.

that nervous fella's always in 'em.

65

- Ha! Should have asked them to hurl some bacon.

a decent breakfast for once.

<i>A little comic strip called</i> Love Is.

It's about two naked eight-year-olds
who are married.

00:05:07,407 --> 00:05:11,036
Mmm! Well, Marge,

72
00:05:14,747 --> 00:05:18,683

<i>that well since I was in the army.</i>

It's good for

78
00:05:38,037 --> 00:05:40,471
Oh, come on, Luann.
You know what this is.

79
00:05:40,573 --> 00:05:42,564
Kirk, I don't know what it is.

80
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:46,702
Oy! It could not be
more simple, Luann.

81
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:50,408
Do you want me to show this to the cat
and have the cat tell you what it is?

82
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:53,883
- 'Cause the cat's gonna get it.
- I'm sorry. I'm not as smart as you, Kirk.

00:05:53,986 --> 00:05:56,511

I gave it up when I married <i>her.</i>

90
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:23,737
Now, Kirk, it's only a game.
Sometimes we-

91
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:28,344
- Oh, cram it, Churchie!
- Maybe we should all have a few drinks.

92
00:06:28,454 --> 00:06:31,116
<i>I'd have a drink,</i>
<i>but it might loosen my tongue.</i>

93
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:33,590
You want to talk?
Go ahead, Luann, talk.

94
00:06:33,693 --> 00:06:36,389
Why don't you tell them one of
your little bedtime stories, huh?

95
00:06:36,496 --> 00:06:40,694
Like the one about how rotten
it is to be married to a loser.

96
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,928
<i>Or how about the one about</i>
<i>how I carry a change purse?</i>

97
00:06:44,036 --> 00:06:46,596
- Yeah, a purse!
- Shut up and let the woman talk!

98
00:06:46,706 --> 00:06:48,833
Okay, Kirk, I'll tell a story.

99
00:06:48,941 --> 00:06:51,603
It's about a man whose
father-in-law gave him a sweet job...

- as manager of a cracker factory.
<i>- [Homer] Boring!</i>

The Van Houtens split up at our party.

Marge, please.
That was 20 minutes ago.

I shouldn't have served
those North Korean fortune cookies.

131

They were so insulting-
"You are a coward."

132

No one likes to hear that
after a nice meal.

You can't keep blaming yourself.
Just blame yourself once and move on.

You know who the real victim
is in all this- Milhouse.

Hey, Van Houten,
I heard your folks broke up.

Aren't you gonna say "Ha-ha"?

137
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:14,981
Oh, by no means. My dad left my mom
after she got hooked on cough drops.

138
00:09:15,087 --> 00:09:18,579
By the end,
her breath was so fresh...

00:09:18,691 --> 00:09:21,421
she wasn't really
my mother anymore.

From now on, forget everything you

Frankly, we don't want to know.

I could have taken just a little time to-
to make her feel special.

It can't just be sex.
It can't!

No wonder I didn't see it coming.

00:13:55,067 --> 00:13:59,504
That's how it is though. One day your wife
is making you your favorite meal...

213
00:13:59,605 --> 00:14:03,803
the next day, you're thawing a hot dog
in a gas station sink.

00:14:03,909 --> 00:14:07,777
Oh, that's tough, pal.
But it's never gonna happen to me.

Well, how do you know?
What makes you guys so special?

over the years and she's stood by you.

- Because there's lots of stuff

This one is for real. I want our marriage

"Do you, Marge, take Homer in richness

00:19:49,588 --> 00:19:54,252
"in impotence and in potence,
in quiet solitude...
