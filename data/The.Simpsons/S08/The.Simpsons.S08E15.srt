331
00:18:00,012 --> 00:18:03,504
No. They were just going to find a deer
and make Bart shoot it.

332
00:18:03,615 --> 00:18:05,981
Deer? Ha! Not around here.

333
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:09,077
They all migrated north when the state park
converted to Astroturf.

But if there's no deer out there,
then what are they hunting?

00:18:12,491 --> 00:18:15,119
Well, the only thing around here that's
even close to deer is-

a reindeer in a pen.
