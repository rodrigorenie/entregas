about Larry Burns for one evening.

162
00:09:45,318 --> 00:09:49,118
Why? It's not like anything interesting
happened to anyone else today.

Hey, Pop, this crowd
is pretty swanky.

166
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:01,290
- I'm not gonna fit in here.
- Nonsense, Larry.

167
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,300
Your blood is bluer
than any of theirs.

168
00:10:03,402 --> 00:10:06,428
Just give them a snootful
of the old Burns charm.

169
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:09,531
Oh, Admiral Carstairs,
I'd like you to meet my son, Larry.

170
00:10:09,642 --> 00:10:11,542
Hey, Skipper, good to meet you.

171
00:10:11,644 --> 00:10:13,612
Where'd you start out,
on the <i>Merrimack?</i>

172
00:10:13,713 --> 00:10:16,773
Hey, I should talk.
I hope I look that good when I'm 200.

173
00:10:16,882 --> 00:10:19,817
- That's such insubordination!
- Larry, please.

174
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:22,046
He's very sensitive about his age.

175
00:10:22,154 --> 00:10:25,590
Oh, Monty, this must be the son
I've heard so much about.

176
00:10:25,691 --> 00:10:31,061
Larry, you must meet our daughter,
the debutante. She came out last spring.

177
00:10:31,163 --> 00:10:36,066
- Whoa! Put her back in! She's not done yet.
- [Scoffs]

178
00:10:38,204 --> 00:10:41,662
Smithers, there's something a bit odd
about young Larry.

179
00:10:41,774 --> 00:10:43,867
I can't quite put
my finger on it.

180
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:46,376
Well, he is a bit rough
around the edges, sir.

181
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:49,812
One might blame his truly heroic
intake of cocktails.

182
00:10:49,915 --> 00:10:51,974
Pull up a seat, Pop.
You too, Chuckles.

183
00:10:52,084 --> 00:10:55,781
I mean, the food ain't great,
but the portions are terrific.

184
00:10:55,888 --> 00:10:59,517
Hey, I'm kidding. Relax.
Hey, give my regards to Mrs. Boyardee.

185
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:02,719
[Shudders]
A total lack of refinement.

186
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:05,422
Smithers, send for the boys
at Yale admissions, hmm?

187
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:09,831
Well, did you meet Larry?

188
00:11:09,935 --> 00:11:12,927
Oh, yes. He made light
of my weight problem...

189
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:16,531
then suggested my motto
should be "Semper Fudge."

190
00:11:16,642 --> 00:11:19,110
At that point
he told me to "relax."

191
00:11:19,211 --> 00:11:22,180
- How were his test scores?
- Let's just say this-

192
00:11:22,281 --> 00:11:24,272
he spelled "Yale" with a six.

193
00:11:24,383 --> 00:11:26,351
I see. Well, l-

194
00:11:26,452 --> 00:11:29,683
Oh, you know, I just remembered
it's time for my annual donation.

195
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:31,757
I wonder how much I should give.

196
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:37,159
Well, frankly, test scores like Larry's
would call for a very generous contribution.

197
00:11:37,263 --> 00:11:41,359
For example, a score of 400 would require
a donation of new football uniforms.

198
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:43,367
Three hundred- a new dormitory.

199
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:46,529
And in Larry's case,
we would need an international airport.

200
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:49,699
Yale could use
an international airport, Mr. Burns.

201
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:53,472
Are you mad?
I'm not made of airports! Get out!

202
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:57,208
Summon my son at once.

Hey, handsome,
send the bill to my dad.

206
00:12:08,794 --> 00:12:12,696
Okay, but the last guy who charged a drink
to Burns turned up in a landfill.

207
00:12:12,798 --> 00:12:15,164
Yeah, but it was worth it.

- Yes, sir, I do.

217
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:51,435
And is he a constant
disappointment?

218
00:12:51,537 --> 00:12:53,596

I'll tell you what's with me-

00:13:06,352 --> 00:13:10,948
the humiliation of having a coarse,
boorish ignoramus for a son.

No esteem either.

realize how much he loves you...

Ooh, give yourself up, Homie!

320
00:18:53,932 --> 00:18:55,763
- No, Dad! Shoot your way out!

[All Screaming]

323
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:03,934
[Kent Brockman]
A bloody end for Homer Simpson...

324
00:19:04,042 --> 00:19:07,569
is just one of several possible outcomes,
according to our computer simulation.

325
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:11,911
Now, here's how it would look if the police
killed him with a barrage of baseballs.

326
00:19:12,017 --> 00:19:14,247
We've gotta go down there
and help Dad.

327
00:19:14,353 --> 00:19:17,652
<i>- [Baseballs Thudding]</i>
<i>- [Homer Groaning] Oh, stop it!</i>

328
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:21,318
Shh.

329
00:19:21,426 --> 00:19:23,587
[Feet Sticking To Floor]

330
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:31,603
- Still warm. They can't be far.
- Chief!

331
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:40,769
[Grunts]

332
00:19:40,879 --> 00:19:44,178
Don't be a fool, Simpson.
Let the kid go.

333
00:19:44,283 --> 00:19:46,547
The negotiations have failed.
Shoot him!

334
00:19:46,652 --> 00:19:49,120
[Cocks Gun]

335
00:19:49,221 --> 00:19:52,190
- Wait!
- [All] Wait?

336
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:54,191
I mean, Homer's no kidnapper.

337
00:19:54,293 --> 00:19:57,456
Well, he's the best friend I ever had.
We faked the whole thing.

338
00:19:57,563 --> 00:19:59,963
[Chattering]

339
00:20:00,065 --> 00:20:03,057
I should've known. You're
the only one stupid enough to kidnap you.

340
00:20:03,168 --> 00:20:06,296
Now, get down here so I can spank you
in front of this gawking rabble.

341
00:20:06,405 --> 00:20:09,806
- Smithers, take off my belt.
- With pleasure, sir.

342
00:20:09,908 --> 00:20:13,844
Hold on, Mr. Burns.
Maybe we did fake a kidnapping.

343
00:20:13,946 --> 00:20:16,437
But is that really such a crime?

344
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:20,382
All your son wanted
was a little attention, a little love.

345
00:20:20,485 --> 00:20:22,578
I'm a father myself, sir.

346
00:20:22,688 --> 00:20:25,657
And, sure, sometimes
my kids can be obnoxious...

347
00:20:25,757 --> 00:20:28,157
<i>or boring, or stinky.</i>

348
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:30,820
But they can always
count on one thing-

349
00:20:30,929 --> 00:20:33,454
their father's unconditional love.

350
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:39,136
- [All] Mmm!
- How about it, Pop?

351
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:42,799
I know it's tough,
but can you love me for what I am?

352
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:45,138
[Groans]

353
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:49,510
Well-
[Mumbles]

354
00:20:49,615 --> 00:20:51,742
There, there, sonny boy.

355
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:54,444
I suppose
I have been a bit-

356
00:20:54,553 --> 00:20:57,647
Oh, no, I can't do it.
It's just not me.

357
00:20:57,756 --> 00:21:02,625
I'm sorry, Larry.
I can't be the family that you need.

358
00:21:02,728 --> 00:21:05,788
Oh, that's okay.
I got a wife and kids.

359
00:21:05,897 --> 00:21:09,094
Oh, that reminds me.
They're probably wondering where I went.

360
00:21:09,201 --> 00:21:11,692
I told them I'm going for coffee.
That was a week ago.

361
00:21:11,803 --> 00:21:14,897
Well, Son, delighted
to have met you.

362
00:21:15,007 --> 00:21:18,807
It's good to know that...
there's another kidney out there for me.

363
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:22,971
You got it, Pop.
Just let me run a few pints through it first.

364
00:21:23,081 --> 00:21:28,951
- As long as everybody's here, let's party!
- [All Cheering]

365
00:21:29,054 --> 00:21:32,387
<i>## [Pop Rock]</i>

366
00:21:37,896 --> 00:21:41,923
- Who's playing that music?
- And where is all that liquor coming from?

367
00:21:42,034 --> 00:21:45,060
It's a party, Marge.
It doesn't have to make sense.

368
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:48,628
<i>- ## [Continues]</i>
- Whoo! Oh, yeah!

369
00:21:58,884 --> 00:21:59,785
<i>## [Continues]</i>

370
00:21:59,785 --> 00:22:02,345
