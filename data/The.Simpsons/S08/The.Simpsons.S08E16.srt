of crazy old Lisa Simpson.

330
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,511
But Cecil just voluntarily
confessed, Chief.

331
00:20:16,615 --> 00:20:19,448
That's some good work, Lou.
You'll make sergeant for this.

332
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:21,451
Uh, I already am sergeant, Chief.

333
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:24,920
Perhaps you are.
But I say Bob goes back to jail.

334
00:20:25,023 --> 00:20:28,720
But surely-
I mean, I caught Cecil!

335
00:20:28,827 --> 00:20:31,853
Maybe so. But Lou here says
you were resisting arrest.

336
00:20:31,964 --> 00:20:33,932
- No, I didn't, Chief.
- Quiet, Lou...

337
00:20:34,032 --> 00:20:38,059
or I will bust you down to sergeant
so fast it'll make your head spin.

338
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:40,638
[Chuckles]
Funny, isn't it, Lise?

339
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:45,642
Those people down there have no idea
how close they came to complete destruction.

340
00:20:53,885 --> 00:20:56,718
Marge, I'm going
to look for the kids!

341
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:00,349
[Gasps]

342
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:01,687
<i>[Rumbling]</i>

343
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:09,201
I think I wet my bed.

344
00:21:09,201 --> 00:21:10,930
But you can't do this!

345
00:21:11,036 --> 00:21:14,301
I saved the children's lives!

346
00:21:14,406 --> 00:21:17,807
- I'm a hero!
- Tell them they'll live to regret this.

347
00:21:17,909 --> 00:21:20,810
You'll live to regret this!

348
00:21:20,912 --> 00:21:23,142
Oh, thanks a lot.
Now I look crazy.

349
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:29,114
There they go, two criminal geniuses
locked away together.

350
00:21:29,221 --> 00:21:33,317
Who knows what diabolical schemes
they might concoct?

351
00:21:40,198 --> 00:21:42,530
[Both Grunting]

352
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:44,795
I'm older!
I get the top bunk!

353
00:21:44,903 --> 00:21:47,838
Oh, poppycock! I called it
at the arraignment! Get back!

354
00:21:52,678 --> 00:21:55,146
So, when do they
bring us the menus?

355
00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:42,593
- [Murmuring]
- Shh.
