00:00:02,252 --> 00:00:05,546
Okay, so we went to the beach because
Phoebe found out about this lady...

2
00:00:05,714 --> 00:00:06,922
...who knew her mom and dad...

3
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:09,383
...and I don't really know
what happened with that.

4
00:00:09,551 --> 00:00:11,552
- I'm your mother.
- Huh?

5
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:14,430
JOEY: Monica joked that she wouldn't
go out with a guy like Chandler.

6
00:00:14,597 --> 00:00:16,098
- Hi there.
JOEY: He couldn't let it go.

7
00:00:16,266 --> 00:00:20,394
I don't really know what happened with that.
And then Ross' new girlfriend shows up...

8
00:00:20,562 --> 00:00:22,771
...and Rachel convinced her
to shave her head.

9
00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:24,565
And then Ross and Rachel kiss.

10
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:27,401
And now Ross has to choose
between Rachel and the bald girl.

11
00:00:27,569 --> 00:00:30,404
And I don't know what happened
there either.

12
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:32,823
You know what? Hold on.
Let me go get Chandler.

13
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:46,795
Hi.

14
00:00:46,963 --> 00:00:48,464
- Hi.
- Hey.

15
00:00:50,258 --> 00:00:52,718
Rachel was just helping me out.
My head got all sunburned.

16
00:00:53,094 --> 00:00:54,470
Aw.

17
00:00:55,513 --> 00:00:58,724
- Thanks a million.
- Oh, you're welcome a million.

18
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:01,643
- Okay, I'll be in our room.
- Uh.

19
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:15,532
Oh, my God.

20
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,326
I know.

21
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:23,874
- Okay, I gotta go.
- Whoa. What? Why?

22
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:26,919
Uh, I gotta go break up with Bonnie.

23
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:29,088
Here? Now?

24
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:31,465
Well, yeah, I can't stay here all night.

25
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:34,718
And if I go in there,
she's gonna want to...

26
00:01:34,886 --> 00:01:35,928
...do stuff.

27
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:39,765
Can't you just tell here
that you are not in the mood?

28
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:41,433
No, she likes that.

29
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:44,937
Ha, ha. Yeah, faking sleep
doesn't work either.

30
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:47,356
I can't tell you how many mornings
I woke up with her...

31
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:49,024
- Oh.
- Oh, okay.

32
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:54,279
- Ha, ha. Yeah, why am I telling you?
- I don't know. Ha, ha.

33
00:02:00,703 --> 00:02:02,538
Uh, uh...

34
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:05,124
- It wasn't every morning...
- Oh, making it worse.

35
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:06,583
Okay.

36
00:02:57,093 --> 00:02:59,761
So I guess you'd like to know
how it all happened.

37
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:02,472
I mean, well, I think I can figure it out.

38
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,932
I guess, you know, I was born...

39
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,476
...and then everyone
started lying their asses off.

40
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:09,771
No, no, it wasn't like that.

41
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:13,442
I mean, remember how I told you
how Lily and Frank and I, we were close?

42
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:16,361
Well, we were very close.

43
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:17,988
How close?

44
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:21,867
Well, the three of us,
we were kind of a, um... A couple.

45
00:03:23,661 --> 00:03:26,038
- I don't even know how that would work.
- Well, we...

46
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:27,331
I'm not asking.

47
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,919
Well, anyhow, somehow I got pregnant...

48
00:03:32,086 --> 00:03:33,629
...and I was...

49
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:37,591
...scared. I was stupid and selfish and...

50
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:39,509
I was 18 years old.

51
00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:42,763
I mean, you remember what it was like
to be 18 years old, don't you?

52
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:45,807
Yeah. Let's see, my mom had killed herself
and my dad had run off.

53
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:49,978
And I was living in a gremlin with a guy
named Cindy, who talked to his hand.

54
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:53,690
Oh, I'm so sorry.

55
00:03:53,858 --> 00:03:56,610
I thought I was leaving you
with the best parents in the world.

56
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:59,988
I didn't even hear about your mom and dad
till a couple of years ago.

57
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:02,074
And by then, you were already grown-up.

58
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:04,826
I don't know. You're here
and I would really...

59
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:06,870
I would like to get to know you.

00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:10,123
Yeah, well, everybody does. Ha, ha.

I'm a really cool person.

62
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:14,753
And you know, you had 29 years
to find that out...

63
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:16,421
...but you didn't even try.

64
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:20,801
You know what? You walked out on me,
and I'm gonna do the same to you.

65
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:24,388
- Wait.
- Okay? I don't ever want to see you again.

very, very important to you. To us.

175
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:35,068
...for everything that went wrong
in our relationship.

about how I was unfaithful to her.

I'm gonna break up with you.

Full responsibility.

Sure, it's hard to forget...

00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:29,245
Fine by me!

346
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:31,789
RACHEL:
Oh, and hey, hey, hey.

347
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:35,167
Those spelling tips will come in handy
when you're at home on Saturday nights...

348
00:21:35,335 --> 00:21:36,794
...playing Scrabble with Monica.

349
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:39,005
- Hey.
- Sorry.

350
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:43,426
I just feel bad about all that sleep you're
gonna miss, wishing you were with me.

351
00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:46,012
Oh, no, no.
Don't you worry about me falling asleep.

352
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:48,764
I still have your letter!

353
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:53,728
And hey, just so you know,
it's not that common.

354
00:21:53,895 --> 00:21:57,815
It doesn't happen to every guy
and it is a big deal!

355
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:00,818
I knew it!

356
00:22:06,074 --> 00:22:07,283
Gin.

357
00:22:08,368 --> 00:22:10,244
We were playing gin?

358
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:15,249
You know, if we were a couple,
we could play this game naked.

359
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:18,085
- Ha, ha. Would you stop?
- Okay.

360
00:22:18,253 --> 00:22:19,754
All right.

361
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:23,257
Okay, all right. I think you're great.

362
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:26,635
I think you're sweet and you're smart...

363
00:22:26,803 --> 00:22:27,887
...and I love you.

364
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:32,683
But you will always be the guy
who peed on me.
