they can go over here, okay?

334
00:19:46,768 --> 00:19:49,061
And the chairs,
they can face this way and...

00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:51,230
You go.

- Yeah?

Do you remember where the duck food is?

345
00:20:21,511 --> 00:20:24,263
Yeah, it's in the guys' apartment,
under the sink. Why?

346
00:20:24,431 --> 00:20:26,474
Because I'm going to London.

347
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:28,893
What? What do you mean,
you're going to London?

348
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:31,020
Yeah, I have to tell Ross that I love him.

349
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:34,815
Now, honey, you take care, and you don't
have those babies till I get back. Mwah.

350
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:37,735
Rachel, you can't go. Ross loves Emily.

351
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:40,988
I know, I know, I know he does,
but I have to tell him how I feel.

352
00:20:41,156 --> 00:20:45,451
He deserves to have all of the information.
Then he can make an informed decision.

That's not why you're going.
You're going because you hope he'll say:

00:20:48,997 --> 00:20:52,792
"Yeah, I love you too, Rach.
Forget about that British chippie."

355
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:55,211
Do you think he will?

356
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:59,173
No, because he's in love
with the British chippie.

357
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:04,720
Look, Rachel, if you go, you're just gonna
mess with his head and ruin his wedding.

358
00:21:04,888 --> 00:21:07,515
You know? It's too late.
You missed your chance.

359
00:21:08,475 --> 00:21:10,476
I'm sorry. I know this must be really hard.
