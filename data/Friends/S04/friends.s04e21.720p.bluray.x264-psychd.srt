Are you handsome.

342
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:46,601
JACK:
Let's show them.

343
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:53,316
- Okay, Dad.
- Rachel, ready or not.

344
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:55,651
Here comes your knight in shining...

345
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:56,944
Oh, no.

346
00:19:57,112 --> 00:20:01,908
MONICA: Bye. Don't wait up.
RACHEL: Okay, Chip, let's go.

347
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,827
JUDY:
Oh, dear.

348
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:06,662
Jack, how do I turn this off?

349
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:11,042
I can't believe you did that.

350
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:13,586
Yeah, well...

351
00:20:31,146 --> 00:20:33,439
See? He's her lobster.

352
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:45,159
No.

353
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:48,162
- You're really not going?
- Yeah.

354
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:50,748
It's just going to be too hard.

355
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:53,376
You know, I mean...

356
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:55,419
...it's Ross.

357
00:20:56,129 --> 00:20:58,714
How can I watch him get married?

358
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:03,302
You know?
It's just for the best, you know? It is.

359
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:06,305
Plus somebody's
got to stay here with Phoebe.

360
00:21:06,556 --> 00:21:09,308
She's going to be pretty big by then...

361
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:12,520
...and she'll need someone
to help her tie her shoes.

362
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:15,940
Drive her to the hospital
in case she goes into labor.

363
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:18,484
You don't have a car.

364
00:21:18,735 --> 00:21:21,153
- And your license expired.
- I know.

365
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:25,616
Yeah. See, there's so much to do,
and I have so little time to do it in.

366
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,457
Check this out.

367
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:37,128
It says there's a place you can go
to rent videos of all the museums.

368
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:40,214
"It's almost as good as being there."

369
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:44,135
It's better. You can't go to a museum
in your underwear.

370
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:47,555
Well, you could,
but probably just the one time.

371
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:51,809
I bet we could get videos
of all the sights...

372
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:55,604
...get a VCR in our hotel room,
we'd never even have to go outside.

373
00:21:56,189 --> 00:21:58,190
If we do that,
we've got to rent Die Hard.

374
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:03,070
Oh-ho, I bet the British version is good.

375
